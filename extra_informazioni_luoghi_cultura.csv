Such activities were most likely introduced in Pescocostanzo around the second half of the fourteenth century when the town, destroyed by a ruinous earthquake in 1456, was rebuilt employing skilled workmen from Lombardy, who moved with their family and brought their heritage of tradition and crafts. Since that time the art of pillow lace has been handed down from mother to daughter for centuries up to the present day. In order to save and preserve such an ancient and precious artistry at the end of the Nineties the municipality created the Scuola per il Tombolo (School of Pillow Lacemaking) and the Craft Museum and Market, set today in the seventeenth-century Fanzago Palace. The school has established itself as an active part in training professional lacemakers through a didactic programme which takes into consideration all phases of lacemaking: from the pattern to the printing, from the choice of the textile to the real technical execution, essentially based on a pricking paper or card called ""sceda"". Along with teaching, the school promotes the making and marketing of the lace.

Made up of four sections, the material on display narrates the historical phases of the area, from the earliest settlement of the Picenians, dated to the XIV century B.C. to the period between the tenth and the first century B.C., when the site was used as a burial place. The most precious finds are undoubtedly the ones dating back to the seventh and sixth century, a real golden age. Among those there are jewels and arms, but first and foremost pottery, noteworthy for its variety and complexity.

The upper level puts on display the long history of Castelli's ceramic art: from the Middle Ages to the Renaissance, with majolica tiles from an old country-chapel and sixteenth-century pitchers. The seventeenth and eighteenth centuries are unquestionably a triumph of Castelli's production: at that time the well-known masters of the Grue and Gentile families lived and operated, painting magnificent historiated ceramics. After a standstill during the early nineteenth-century, the majolica handicraft flourished again drawing near the porcelain decorations, in vogue at that time.</div>"

In 1861 he moved to Florence to visit the National Exposition. He settled there and started to frequent the artists assembled around Duprè.

The chief nucleus of the collection is represented by the works of the so called ""School of Posillipo"", a group of artist characterized by an excellent drawing and a conscious use of colors in realistic reproductions, who really renovate the landscape-painting. The collection contains canvases by Pitoo, Gigante, Duclére, Consalvo and Raffaele Carelli. Besides them there are nineteenth-century painters from the Abruzzi, such as Filippo and Nicola Palizzi, Gennaro della Monica and Michetti. The beautiful collection covers three centuries: from the nineteenth-century production of Domenico Morelli and Vincenzo Gemito, it goes backwards to Francesco Solimena (early seventeenth century) and Jusepe Ribera, called ""the Spaniard"" (first half of the seventeenth century), through the eighteenth-century masterpieces of Pompeo Batoni and Vincenzo Camuccini. The art gallery was inaugurated in 1978, along with the historical material which Bindi himself bestowed on the library. The pictures are arranged on the walls of Bindi's aristocratic house, surrounded by antique furniture and precious ornaments left by the important historian. &nbsp;</div>"

129,100123,traduzioni_descrizione,en,"Musma, the Museum of Contemporary Sculpture Matera, is located within the impressive framework of the 16th century Palazzo Pomarici, in the heart of the Sassi. This unique museum provides the perfect environment for the symbiosis of sculpture and the characteristic carved sites in the Sassi; the exhibition galleries, in fact, consist not only of the rooms of the Palazzo, but also the vast hypogea, where the works of art are revitalized by the strength and beauty of the surrounding rock hewn spaces. The museum project was born of the conviction that the Sassi of Matera—partly carved out of the rock and partly modeled with rock by folk masonry wisdom—provided a site extraordinarily adapted for presenting sculpture exhibitions. An ancient city like Matera should not live only on its past but must understand how to transform its historical heritage into a new culture.<br>The Museum of Contemporary Sculpture maintains not only a permanent collection of the work of international sculptures, but also hosts changing exhibitions in its efforts to explore the artistic language of our times. The idea to incorporate the suggestive environment of the rock caves as exhibition spaces has deep roots: MUSMA is the fruit of 30 years of experience of Matera’s “La Scaletta” Club which, beginning in 1978, annually presented the “Great Exhibitions of the Sassi of Matera.” The wealth of experience, knowledge, and relationships built over this period of time has not been lost. For this reason, MUSMA is also the “Museum of Friendship.” <br>The Museum’s Scientific Committee is formed by: Giuseppe Appella (Curator of MUSMA), Pier Giovanni Castagnoli (Director of Turin Modern Art Civic Museum), Fabrizio D’Amico (University of Pisa), Michele D’Elia (former Director of the Central Institute of Restoration and Scientific Director of the Zétema Foundation, Matera), Rosalba Zuccaro (“La Sapienza” University of Rome). Palazzo Pomarici was restored under the supervision of the Architect A. Zanmatti, who also installs the exhibitions. MUSMA’s logo was designed by Mario Cresci."

348,110900,traduzioni_descrizione,en,"The Complex - which includes the Church, the Museum and the Hypogeum (the Lower Church) - represents an extraordinary opportunity to learn about the ancient cult of the souls in Purgatory. In 1605 a group of nobles founded a charitable institution (“Opera Pia”), a laic Congregation, which had among the main purposes that of “taking care” of the souls in Purgatory. The elegant Church, designed by Giovan Cola di Franco, was built from the outset on two levels: the upper church, a true masterpiece of Baroque Neapolitan, and the lower church, or Hypogeum, where still today takes place the worship of poor (“pezzentelle”) souls. Of great value is the iconography of the Church: on the Altar there is the masterpiece by Massimo Stanzione, The Madonna of the souls of purgatory, which is surmounted from a painting of Giacomo Farelli, named Saint Anne offers the baby Virgin to the Lord, and in the side chapels a painting by Andrea Vaccaro, The Transit of St. Joseph, and a painting by Luca Giordano, The Ecstasy of Saint Alexis The complex also houses a small, precious Museum (“Museo dell’Opera”), that hosts a collection of paintings and objects made between the seventeenth and the nineteenth century the Historical Archive and a medical clinic dedicated to the needies. <br>"

The Palace, an old castle built to control the territory, was remodelled several times. It shows the traditional Cilento building with terraced courtyards. It hosted Gian Battista Vico for nine years (1686-1695), as a tutor to the sons of the then owner, Marchese Rocca. The restoration of the representative area of the Palace, which was acquired by the Vico Foundation, occurred in 1994, driven by the needs expressed by Elena Croce, daughter of the philosopher and the lawyer. G. Marotta, president of the Institute for Philosophical Studies in Naples. Their heartfelt appeal was raised by the lawyer. V. Pepe, who is now president of the Giambattista Vico Foundation supported by the President of the Province, A. Andria who began the difficult restoration completed by the National Park of Cilento and Vallo di Diano. The validity of the restoration carried out was supported by many authoritative testimonies, including the most rewarding part of the Prof. La Valva. Today the heart of the museum complex is the conference room where they hold meetings, seminars and conferences of great quality and appeal, including the prestigious Gian Battista Vico Prize. <br>"

painting and were touched by the main Bolognese Baroque painters of that
 time, which on the one side shows the mature phase of Canuti, and on 
the other side introduces Crespi and Creti with their style which 
recalls the eighteenth century. The rooms contain a significant 
selection of paintings by Zambeccari, which form part of the most 
important elements of the city’s painting history. There are works by 
the earlier painters of the Emilia Romagna region like those by Lodovico
 Carracci, Guercino, Albani and Crespi, and also Passerotti, Tiarini, 
Mastelletta, Franceschini, Pasinelli and Crete. In addition to this, 
there are also some fine arts from Painting schools in different regions

house formed part of the complex of Corpus Domini, the ceilings of the 
rooms on the first floor (XVI century), were decorated with grotesques 
that adorn the façades. The property was acquired by the State in 1898. 
Casa Romei became a veritable museum in 1953 and received collections of
 frescoes, statues and lapidaries from city buildings.<br></div>"

<p class=""MsoNormal""><font class=""Apple-style-span"" face=""Arial""></font></p><p align=""justify"">The <a href=""http://www.pinacotecaferrara.it/index.jsp"">Gallery</a> was established in 1836 as an initiative 
by the Municipality of Ferrara. The site chosen was the “Piano Nobile” 
(main floor) of the Palazzo dei Diamanti, which displays for the public 
many of the great altarpieces from churches which were suppressed by 
Napoleon as well as paintings purchased from private collections in the 
city. In 1958 the Art Gallery was acquired by the State and became the 
National Art Gallery. Gradually added to the original collection were 
works which were acquired through deposits, donations (Vendeghini-Baldi 
collection), and purchases by the Cassa di Risparmio di Ferrara who 
placed its collection in the Gallery, so that the public could enjoy the
 artistic heritage of Ferrara which was acquired on the antiquities 
market. Since 2004 this commitment was assumed by the Foundation of the 
Cassa di Risparmio (Carife Foundation) which took over the collection 
which was formed by the fund. </p><p></p>

<a href=""http://www.archeobologna.beniculturali.it/sarsina/note_en.htm"">archeological museums</a> in northern Italy for the abundance and variety of
 the finds that it contains. It was established in 1890 as a municipal 
collection and has since expanded with finds recovered from the 
excavation of the necropolis of Pian di Bezzo and within the city, until
 it was acquired by the State in 1957. The collections of the museum 
almost exclusively of local origin cover mostly the Roman Age from the 
First century B.C and the Second to Third century. A.D., even though the
 entire chronological period represented in the collection extends from 
prehistory to late antiquity. The radical restructuring done in 1990 led
 to the full consolidation of some large funerary epigraphs, among 
which, the mausoleum of Rufus, which is some 13.5 meters high and dating
 from the late first century. B.C, is noted for its grandeur and is one 
of the major attractions. Also of great importance is the beautiful 
polychrome mosaic floor, known as ""The Triumph of Dionysos"" and the 
group of statues connecting numerous cult practices of the Orient. The 
set of findings provides a complete reading of the history of ancient 
Sassina, the birthplace of Plauto. The city, founded as the capital of 
the Umbrian people who inhabited the valley of Savio, which after the 
Roman conquest became a thriving municipality, linked to Ravenna by 
close trade and cultural relations. <br>&nbsp;<br></div>

The arrangement is the result of thorough territorial research, whose results are offered to the public with an emphasis on the communication dimension: the museum “scenography” is mostly based on installations, scenery, game simulations, listening stations, sculptures that emerge from walls, and other devices to involve the visitor in an itinerary that activates senses, emotions and curiosity. The layout, Ma chi mai aveva visto niente! Il ‘900, una comunità, molti racconti (But who has never seen anything! The 1900s, a community, many tales), is dedicated to Roccagorga; the itinerary winds through seven rooms: “Quelli della Rocca”, “Cinema Splendore”, “Pasqua rossa”, “Habitus”, “Grani di storia”, “Garage-cultura” and “Noi loro”. The Ethno-Museum is part of the Demos System and the Territorial System of the Lepini Mountains, within which it represents the reference pole for Demo-Ethno-Anthropological themes. "

Thanks to research carried out by the archaeological Superintendency of the Lazio region and the Institute for Etruscan-Italic Archaeology of the National Research Council which unearthed the remains of these ancient cities, it has been possible to delineate the historical and cultural profile of this population that settled in Sabina starting from the second half of the 8th century B.C. up to the Roman conquest in the 3rd century B.C. The characteristics of the museum materials, as well as the fact the they come from an inhabited area (Cures) and a necropolis (Eretum), have made it possible to reconstruct a portrait of Sabine society – thanks to the comparison between the town of the living and that of the dead – that, until the first years of the 20th century, constituted a sort of “grey area” in the cultures of ancient Italy."

The residence owed its construction to the documented passion of Traianus for hunting, as well as to the sovereign’s desire of having a comfortable and private summer hideaway. The Antiquarium is located within the archaeological area inside two small country houses and it hosts the collection of the most important findings discovered during recent excavation campaigns: architectural elements and bricks bearing footprints of wild animals; everyday objects and tools; a fluted marble basin and some hollow vessels; some paintings and wall stuccos.

The inhabitants of Arsoli have contributed significantly to enriching the museum's collection: standing out among the finest musical instruments on display are some donated by the Massimo family, which played a central role in the birth and development of the band tradition of Arsoli, which is still alive and well rooted in the town. The museum is located on the ground floor of the old “Granaio Massimo” and overlooks Corso Borgo San Bartolomeo, the main artery connecting the mediaeval heart of the town to its two main squares. The distribution of objects throughout the exhibition has been deliberately designed to favour the organological criterion of use. Musical instruments, preserved in modern caskets, are grouped into three categories: agro-pastoral and urban-craft tools, religious instruments and band instruments. A didactic system together with four photographic installations illustrates the construction techniques, history, repertoires and context of use of the individual musical traditions of Arsoli and more generally of the Aniene valley."

The historical artistic collection is arranged by themes and exhibits pieces that illustrate the institutional, artistic and religious life of the town. A small, but interesting collection of vestments is exhibited in a showcase equipped with a multimedia device that describes its contents. Particularly prestigious is the Bust of Christ attributed to the late 15th century circle of Andrea Bregno, and the Venus and Adonis sculpture by Cristoforo Stati, realised in the early 1600s and donated by the artist to his native town. The 18th century manikin of the Madonna with her wardrobe of clothes is also of interest.

The exhibition follows the main winemaking chain processes: from cultivation of the grapevine to harvest, from transformation of the grapes to the bottling and selling of the wine, documenting at the same time the material culture of rural Italy over the last 80 years. Parallel to the permanent exhibition spaces, the museum hosts and promotes periodical initiatives linked to the world of wine: meetings of sector experts, courses in enology, food and wine events and exhibitions from other regions or countries.

The second displays trappings from two burials dating back to the seventh century BC, found in the necropolis of the ancient Latin town of Crustumerium, located near today's Settebagni. The ancient town of Crustumerium, which was to have exercised its power even over most of the territory of modern-day Monterotondo, enjoyed an important strategic position and for this reason was a target for Rome’s expansionist ambitions. Various attempts were made to conquer it, with the first occurring at the hands of Romulus who, through deceipt, kidnapped the women of Crustumerium, along with the Sabine women. The city was finally conquered by the Romans in 499 BC and turned into a military outpost to control incursions by the Veii and the Sabines who had not yet been subdued. The third section houses a tomb, dating from the late seventh-early sixth century BC, on the base of the metallic remains of a belt. The tomb was discovered near Cretone during archaeological excavations conducted by the management of the museum in collaboration with the Superintendence for Archaeological Heritage of Lazio, in the context of a research project aimed at learning about the dynamics of settlement of the border area between the Latins and the Sabines, which includes today's Monterotondo.

The works – paintings, graphic works, sculptures – represent the artistic and cultural phenomenon known as the Roman School, which developed in Rome in the period between the two wars (1918-1945)."

The first public facility to produce electricity, named after Giovanni Montemartini, it now houses a considerable part of the sculptures of classical antiquity that were unearthed during the excavations carried out in Rome in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The exhibition reconstructs the ancient monumental complexes that trace the development of the city from the Republican to the late imperial periods with particularly significant episodes that are often almost unknown to the general public, as in the case of very large mosaic with hunting scenes from S. Bibiana. The vast rooms of the Centrale, in particular the Engine Room with its fine Liberty-style furnishings, preserve unchanged turbines, diesel engines and the colossal steam boiler. Against this striking backdrop, the ancient marbles splendour for their translucent clarity and refined carving. In fact, some masterpieces of ancient sculpture seem to be enhanced in this atmosphere that evokes on the one hand the monumental grandeur of ancient Rome and on the other a more recent past and the memory of one of the early Roman industrial environments."

The first, external, itinerary visits the most interesting sites of the Ostia reclamation area: low and high water channels, large low water collection tanks and antique and modern drainage pump systems. In the main building of the plant (1884) it is possible to see the machine room practically in its original conditions, preserving the first hydraulic lifting pumps in working order. Full-scale models of countryside huts and some agricultural tools are exhibited in the garden area. The second, internal, itinerary is divided into various sections that represent different themes and moments linked to the reclamations and the physical and anthropogenic transformations of the territory: the coast countryside before the 19th century; the hygienic-health situation of the countryside and legislation concerning reclamation of the capital; discoveries regarding the transmission of malaria and the fight against malaria; the emergence of cooperation in the Ravenna peonage; the reclamation project for the Roman coast; the creation and development of contemporary settlements. Photographic documents of the period; memoires and findings; objects of domestic use and original work tools; testimonials, songs, sounds and testimonies in video and audio registrations of the protagonists and owners of the memories of a lifetime during the last century; and reconstructions and plastic models in scale of the reclamation area are presented in various rooms. A special model with water lifting pumps simulates the operation of the reclamation system."

Thus a superlative heritage of modern art, one of the finest in Rome today, has come down to us after nearly a century. Sculptures, paintings, drawings and prints: masterpieces created by great artists between the second half of the 19th century and the middle of the 20th testify to the best of that era in Rome and recount the city’s history, not only its art. Visitors can admire a careful selection of works from the Gallery’s permanent collection, which contains more than three thousand pieces. The exhibition meanders among the different art movements present in Italy in the century-long period covered by the permanent collection, from Vincenzo Gemito’s Neapolitan realism to Nino Costa and Hirémy Hirschl’s symbolist aesthetics, from Adolfo De Carolis and Duilio Ciambellotti’s Liberty-style interpretations to the portraits painted by Roman Divisionists, to the artistic culture of the interwar period. Here the show illustrates Felice Carena’s rediscovery of classicism, Mario Sironi’s “Novecento” movement, Antonio Donghi’s Magic Realism and Enrico Prampolini’s Futurist explorations, and continues with masterpieces from the Thirties: Scipione and the Roman School in painting, Arturo Martini and Marino Marini in sculpture."

The collections have a close relationship with the city of Rome, from which most of the works come. By solemnly giving the People of Rome some ancient bronze statues already stored at the Lateran (the She-Wolf, the Spinario, Camillo and the colossal head of Constantine, with the globe and hand) in 1471, Pope Sixtus IV constituted the first nucleus of the Capitoline Museums. Significant sculptural works (including, among others, the gilded bronze statue of Hercules from the Forum Boarium, marble fragments from the acrolith of Constantine of the Basilica of Maxentius, and the three panels in relief with the exploits of Marcus Aurelius, the so-called Capitoline Brutus) and important inscriptions (including the Fasti Capitolini, found in the Roman Forum) were placed in the Campidoglio in the middle of the 16th century. The two colossal statues of the Tiber and the Nile, currently outside the Senatorial Palace, were transferred in the same year from the Quirinale, while the equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius was brought from the Lateran in 1538 at the behest of Pope Paul III. The exhibition itinerary has been significantly extended with the public opening of the Tabularium, connected to the other buildings through the Galleria di Congiunzione, the rehabilitation of Palazzo Caffarelli and the acquisition of Palazzo Clementino, already home to offices. The museum has been enriched by new sections: the Medagliere Capitolino in Palazzo Clementino and the Galleria Lapidaria in the Galleria di Congiunzione. Additional measures include the transformation of the Roman Garden into a large hall with windows and the reorganization of the Castellani Collection, the rooms of the Roman gardens and the section dedicated to the Roman temple of Jupiter Capitolinus."

Exploiting this ambivalence of being a container of excellence of its own history and the history of the town, the exhibition dedicated to the Imperial Fora, which were an integral part of that complex of buildings destined to the administration of activities and operations of the greatest and most famous of the Fora, the forum desired by Emperor Traianus, was organised. Instead of exhibiting single fragments (even if beautiful) of a past decorative splendour, their architectonical-sculptural decoration has been recomposed, in an attempt to enable the visitor to perceive the complexity of an ancient building yard, its work system and its technology, and at the same time, to try to revive the real environment of the Imperial period: the activities carried out in the Fora and the people that frequented them."

The aim of the collector was to create a small museum of “ancient comparative sculpture” bringing together Egyptian, Assyrian, Phoenician, Cypriot, Etruscan, Greek, Roman and Mediaeval art, and offering a limited but complete panorama of the artistic expression of the main ancient civilisations of the Mediterranean. The collection, which grew until the collector passed away in 1914, was initially housed in a museum built specifically for that purpose by Barracco and designed by Gaetano Koch in Corso Vittorio Emanuele II at the crossroads with the Lungotevere. Urban works of the 1930s led to the demolition of the building and the collection only found its current definitive location in 1948 in the settings of the 16th century Palazzo della Farnesina ai Baullari. The collection, the result of an accurate choice of the cultured collector, contains some real masterpieces of ancient art; exceptional examples of Egyptian and Assyrian art, a prestigious collection of original Greek works, a small but significant and rare collection of Cypriot art, important and sophisticated Roman copies of original Greek ones, and some examples of mediaeval art."

The Museum, which occupies three floors, is part of a complex of buildings that also includes the headquarters of the Venanzo Crocetti Foundation, the atelier of the sculptor and a multi-purpose room where exhibitions of other artists, conventions and concerts, and book presentations are organised. The Crocetti Museum houses the works realised by the sculptor in more than seventy years of creative activity. Among the masterpieces exhibited, worth noting are Il Cavaliere della Pace (1987), a poetic and stylistically perfect work due to its proportions and the sinuosity of its forms; Fanciulla al fiume (1934), a sketch for Saint Peters Gate dated ‘1958; La Maddalena (1973-76), with sensational drapes, the creature in the wind of life; Modella che si riordina i cappelli (1985). The Museum opens with a splendid bronze Gate that arouses a strong emotional impact with its reliefs depicting themes about the work of man, studies, astronomic observations and the arts and trades of man.

In summer, the beautiful courtyard of the palace becomes a place of open-air culture equipped with a stage and seats, and hosting local theatre groups and musical concerts.

Through a geological, anthropological, botanic and faunal itinerary, it offers interpretative tools for discovering the Monte Soratte Nature Reserve. Set in a framework of 16th century frescoes and huge period fireplaces, it is possible to observe the tracks of the animals that inhabit the woods, identify the most characteristic plants of the area, understand the origins of the underground caves of Mount Soratte and imagine the life of the original populations inhabiting the area by observing prehistoric tools. Temporary exhibitions, educational activities and cycles of conferences make this Museum a lively cultural centre for tourists, researchers and nature lovers. About two million years ago, Soratte emerged as a calcareous island in the tropical sea of Pliocene, which used to cover the current roman countryside and Lazio coast. Today, the relief dominates the Tiber plain and the large blanket of volcanic lands present to the north of Rome. Because of its isolated nature, it has always been an important area of worship."

The collection is composed of the most ancient nucleus, the Nardini collection, and works that were added later. About seven hundred finds belong to the first nucleus: the terracotta architectural sheets (6th century B.C.) belonging to an Etruscan-Italic temple and the Sarcophagus of the prayer (4th century A.D.), and a tomb stone with scenes from the Old and New Testament are of particular interest. During the 1900s, important finds converged in the civic collection, such as the monumental Sarcophagus of the labours of Hercules (2nd century A.D.), and the Civitana Sarcophagus (3rd century A.D.). The first is also known as the Sarcophagus of Velletri, and is surely one of the most significant works of Roman art: ""mythical"" for the beauty of the rich decoration, and ""mythical"" for the different myths to which the represented theme connects (myths of Hercules, Protesilao, Proserpina and Alcesti). In 2003, the collection was enriched with the Pellegrini donation, a nucleus of one hundred and seventy fragments of Campana sheets, simas, covering sheets, and coping blocks coming from Madonna degli Angeli, where, by tradition, Villa degli Ottavi was located and the future emperor Cesare Ottaviano Augustus spent his childhood.

The rural road system, the mild spring temperatures, the numerous spontaneous blossoms, and the peculiar shapes of the gullies that characterise and change the surrounding scenery make the entire valley a fascinating site for excursions that is as appealing as it is unknown to many and, therefore, remains to be discovered.

1070,101633,traduzioni_descrizione,en,"The museum is located inside the Town Hall, a splendid Renaissance building designed by Antonio da Sangallo the Younger. Currently it is possible to visit only two rooms, but a new structure which will allow a wider exhibition of the materials that cover a period of time going from the 7th century B.C. up to the Renaissance age is being built. The first room of the Museum contains material from the necropolises dating back to the Faliscan age that surround the inhabited area. Many of the finds date back to the 7th century B.C. (Orientalising period) and come from the Cerro necropolis. In the second room, there are different types of objects from various periods. The Roman age is mainly represented by a small coin section and marble fragments, to which some burial and votive altars, temporarily placed inside the Town Hall will be added. The most recent finds belong to the period of maximum splendour of Nepi, that is, the 15th-16th century. There are also a couple of coats of arms bearing the symbols of the family together with those of the Aragonese from Forte dei Borgia: the friezes represent rare evidence of the period when Lucrezia Borgia, after having married Alfonso d'Aragona Duke of Bisceglie, was invested by her father, Alessandro VI, with the Duchy of Nepi (1499-1501).

1074,101636,traduzioni_descrizione,en,"The collection presents works of considerable quality and interest, mainly coming from no longer officiated churches in Orte and its former diocese. There are numerous panels with gold background from the 12th – 16th century of the northern Lazio, Roman, Umbrian and Sienese schools, and paintings, marbles, silver and vestments. Standing out among these are San Francesco e storie della vita by an anonymous 13th century artist, Madonna advocata by Taddeo di Bartolo, Madonna col Bambino by Pastura, and the large San Michele painting by the Flemish Antonio da Castello. Particularly important is the 8th century mosaic of the Byzantine Madonna, one of the few fragments of the Oratory of John VII in the old Saint Peter’s Basilica. The main museum centre is located in the former Romanesque church of San Silvestro, a single nave construction of the 11th century. Recently the exhibition offer was widened with a second section housed in the nearby Episcopal Palazzo of Orte, although currently this can be visited only by booking. The Episcopal see of Orte has been attested to since the end of the 5th century and the Palazzo, which already existed from the 13th century, was enlarged to its current forms many times up to the 17th century. Apart from paintings, it houses the historical diocesan Archive of Orte and the historical Library of the former Orte Seminary. This second collection brings together paintings that range from the end of the 1500s to the end of the 1700s, thus continuing the time period of the works kept in the main location. These paintings are by local artists or by artists from more qualified areas, above all Roman and Bolognese, with points of excellence in S. Andrea – attributed to Cesare Nebbia – and in other possible attributions that are still in the study phase, to Sassoferrato, Lorenzo Masucci and Domenico Corvi."

The 15th century building was transformed into the Civic Hospital and now on the second floor there is the Historical Archive and Public Library. The museum houses many historical items regarding Sutri and its territory: sculptures, epigraphs, frescoes, paintings, documents and fragments of hand written codes that make it possible to following the lines of the rich historical profile of this city. Sutri was an important Roman centre, an Episcopal seat in 465 and an important staging point of itineraries towards Rome throughout the Middle Ages. The museum itinerary is divided between the ground floor and the lower ground floor. The first room is dedicated to paintings from the Church of San Francesco, and some frescoes from the Church of Santa Fortunata, one of which dates back to the early 1200s and depicts Pope Innocent III. The processional vexillum, attributed to the painter Eugenio Agneni, is in the same room. Among other pieces worth mentioning are some Roman, early Middle Age and Romanesque sculptures and inscriptions. Documents and fragments of hand written codes dating back to the 11th-16th centuries which are preserved in the Civic Historical Archive are very important for understanding the town’s cultural history."

It is divided in two main sections: Prehistoric, and Mediaeval Renaissance and Modern. Artefacts from the most important sites of the north of the Lazio region (Tuscia) and dating back to a period running between the late Palaeolithic and the early Iron Age are exhibited in the first section. In the second section, there are finds that narrate the development of the territory starting from the early Middle Ages, with particular attention to the history of the Farnese family between 1300 and 1600. The collection of majolicas in the so-called butti of the castle is remarkable, including the wedding supplies of Pier Luigi Farnese and Gerolama Orsini (1519). In a small room of the tower, a collection with precious ceramics from Cerveteri and Vulci donated by Bishop Giovanni D’Ascenzi is exhibited. Rocca Farnese, inhabited by the family of the same name from the mid-15th century until the destruction of Castro, constitutes an interesting architectural and historic-artistic itinerary, including the Cortile d’Amore and the well of Sangallo, the loggia of Paolo III and the “Scala Santa”. the panoramic terrace from which the top of the great octagonal Tower can be accessed. The panoramic terrace from which the top of the great octagonal Tower can be reached is charming and picturesque. "

It preserves materials that range from the Faliscan period up to modern times. From an archaeological and scientific point of view, the most important finds are those discovered by the Superintendency for Southern Etruria during excavations carried out in 1984-85 in the locality of Cesurli, in a place called Poggio della Mentuccia. The handicrafts tradition that mostly characterises this area and the realisation of ceramics destined to be fired that were still being produced and sold throughout the Lazio region in the 20th century are narrated through images and objects. Thanks to a donation of the Misciattelli family, some pieces from the modern “Ceramica Bassanello” factory, which operated until 1978 and produced objects of rare beauty and quality that were exported all over the world, are on show. Lastly, some statues by Giulio Francesconi, a 20th century artist, show his ties with the ceramic production of Vasanello."

The exhibition is articulated on three levels, in two chronological sections: the ancient era on the lower floor, the Middle Ages and modern period on the upper floors. The Cloister and adjacent rooms house Etruscan and Roman archaeological finds from the Viterbo territory covering a chronological period that runs from the 8th century B.C. to the 3rd century A.D.: sarcophagi, funerary stones, and slab fragments (mostly from Ferento). A room is dedicated to Annio from Viterbo and the false relics that the friar realised to support his hypotheses about the Etruscan history of the main city of Tuscia. The first floor exhibits the historical-artistic section, formed after the Unification of Italy: mediaeval paintings and sculptures (including the Madonna con bambino by Vitale da Bologna and the Sfinge by Pasquale Romano) and modern era paintings (Pietà and Flagellazione by Sebastiano del Piombo, works of the Viterbo school and of Salvator Rosa, Antiveduto Grammatica and Aurelio Lomi). The second floor is reserved for the minor arts and historical memories. A 16th century papal treasure and a set of 18th century chemist’s ceramics, as well as a collection of drawings-designs of the “Macchina di Santa Rosa”, are exhibited. The exhibition ends with a gallery of 18th century portraits."

Its realisation was made possible thanks to the combined intervention of the Diocesan Curia of Viterbo and the Italian Prime Minister’s Office. Through the interest of Monsignor Lorenzo Chiarinelli, Bishop of Viterbo, and Monsignor Salvatore del Ciuco, current Director of the Museum, some unused premises near the Cathedral were refurbished and fitted out by Maestro Alessio Paternesi. Currently, the Museum is divided into 3 sections: archaeological, historical-artistic and sacred art, that can be combined with the guided tour to parts of the Cathedral of San Lorenzo that otherwise cannot be visited, such as the sacristy and the Baroque choir, and main rooms of the Palazzo dei Papi (Popes’ Palace), such as the Loggia and Conclave Chamber where the first and longest conclave of the church’s history was held. The Museum promotes guided tours to the mediaeval districts and main monuments of the city of Viterbo and its province all year round. Moreover, it is possible to book the guided tour directly from the Museum website. The museum is “Punto” (Pilgrimage stop) of via Francigena and offers information to pilgrims for reception in the city."

On the lower floor it is possible to admire ten small-scale models of the various Macchine of Santa Rosa, exhibited in chronological order, starting from one dated 1690 up to the models of the 20th century, including ""Ali di luce"" (Wings of Light) conceived by architect and porter Raffaele Ascenzi. The section will soon be enriched with additional models, including the current machine “Fiore del cielo” (Flower of Heaven) by Arturo Vittori. On the first floor there is the audiovisual room where it is possible to see videos covering recent and past forms of transport, in order to be able to recreate in visitors the same attraction and emotion that this spectacular event arouses in the thousands of people that visit Viterbo in the evening of 3 September every year. On the last floor, not open to the public, a welcoming hall hosts the Sodalizio (Fellowship) council chamber, where the Directive Committee for the execution of activities concerning the life of the Sodalizio meets weekly.

The structure was founded in 1996, thanks to the initiative of the Carivit Foundation and the Municipality of Viterbo, and is one of the most interesting cultural realities of the city. The museum occupies the ground floor rooms of the 17th century Palazzo Brugiotti and is divided into five large spaces with an exhibition itinerary that presents the evolution of ceramic production in Viterbo and the northern Lazio Region, from the first achromatic bisque and glazed shapes, to enamelled objects up to ceramic baking pans of the 19th century. Most of the ceramic artefacts exhibited were found in drainage wells, commonly called “butti”, in the historical city centres of Northern Lazio. These are wells excavated in the tufa inside the houses of the Mediaeval period and used to collect any kind of liquid and solid waste, such as waste from the everyday table or broken furnishings. In recent years with the refurbishment of historical centres, many wells have been discovered and, together with bones and other materials, revealing many ceramic fragments today patiently reconstructed by restorers.

In June 20th1987, the Museum was born and opened in Tino Sana srl Company premises and then moved in its new and definitive seat in Papa Giovanni XXIII street. The new building, designed by Arch. Cesare Rota Nodari, opened in October, 28th 2000: it has three floors for a total of 3500 sqm with an outside waterfall working saw-mill.
The carpenter's story is told through the disposition of the shops presenting several trades of wood working, with the antique wood-made machines and with some old lathes from 1600/1700/1800.
Many expressions of people life have been associated to the wood from houses to the shops of the old crafts.
At the Museum many bikes are on exhibition some wooden bikes of XIX century, some bikes of XX century and the bikes, T-shirts and trophies belonging to one of our most representative champion: Felice Gimondi, to whom the room is dedicated and where there are also some working tools used by street trader, who worked using a bicycle.
The Museum documents the use of wood in the means of transport: in the sledges, in the boats, in the regional carts, in the gigs, in the carriages and cars and even in the planes. On exhibition there is a plane which belonged to a much-decorated Italian pilot: Mr Antonio Locatelli.
With the hand-made puppets and their wood house, made by artists from Bergamo, there is an artist shop ""Brusafer"" of Aldo Caratti for iron hand-working.
The Museum has also a library-conference room and some rooms for the drawing school and an equipped area for wood working training school.
Whoever visits my Museum will see what I feel in looking at these objects and what they represent for me: the engagement, the efforts, the art and above all my love for one of the trade born with the Man.

          This institution was the result of the decision taken by Count Giacomo Carrara (1714-1796) to create a school of fine arts with adjoining picture gallery in accordance with the Enlightenment idea of spreading culture through society. On his death, the Carrara Academy grew so quickly that new neoclassical premises were designed by Simone Elia and completed in 1810. The 19th century saw only one important purchase, namely the collection of the Venetian patrician Orsetti (1804), and the two major bequests (Lochis in 1866 and Morelli in 1891), but also the only great dispersal of works, by public auction in 1835. The academy was well established in its role as a municipal museum when it underwent its first modern reorganization, based no longer on the collections of illustrious connoisseurs for which it provided a setting but on chronological and regional criteria (Corrado Ricci, 1912 and 1930). The new arrangement of 1955 (G.A. Dell'Acqua and Fernanda Wittgens) remained in place until the ongoing closure for renovation work (2008). The collections now comprise about 1,800 paintings, 3,000 drawings, 8,000 prints and 80 sculptures (plus the 46 important works of the Federico Zeri bequest of 1998) as well as works of the minor arts, furniture, a library with many volumes once owned by Giacomo Carrara, and materials from the academy (paintings, drawings, cartoons and plaster sculptures).

Spread to a number of scattered buildings in the village, the museum conserves many documents of the postal, and non-postal, activities of the illustrious Tasso family.
Theses documents include a letter from 1840 stamped with the English famous ""Penny Black"", the first postage stamp over the world.
Another room of the museum is also dedicated to the two literary glories of Tasso family: Bernerd and his most famous son Torquato, the author of the great renown poem ""Jerusalem delivered"".
Finally, a room of the museum conserves instruments created during 19th and 20th centuries to improve the transmission of information, as telegraph and telephone: important tecnological developmentwhich have brought an end to the absolute monopoly of the letter, with enormous advantages in terms of the speed and of the trasmission of the information.

          The Museum of Natural History was founded in 1891 by the Rector Don Francesco Benedetti, who appointed two skilled, expert teachers Don Bernardino Gavazzeni from Strozza and Don Enrico Caffi from San Pellegrino to take care of the collection, providing for a well-documented and illustrated catalogue. The exhibition of the museum extends over a surface of around 300 square metres. In 1999 the administrator Giambattista Rivellini, faithfully following the conservative criterions of the nineteenth-century which pointed out the correct guidelines for the exhibition of the rarities on show, provided for the re-location of the museum in the original area, though animals, fossils and vegetation were maintained in the appropriate original closets and reliquaries. At first sight, at the entry of the museum, a huge brown bear is of great impact. The bear was captured at Primaluna a small village in Valsassina in 1886 and is of great relevance, since the sample, on show, is one of the latest, well-kept and integral bears captured on the Pre-Alpine area. In a specific room four very precious volumes of the herbarium - collected, illustrated and commented by the late parish-priest of Olate don Luigi Sacchi in 1850 - are still preserved. The unique, precious work is currently open to be consulted for study. Exotic as well as European mammals are on show along the inner aisle, besides two reliquaries with samples of birds (ornithology fauna), a collection of invertebrate mollusks: rare samples of malacology (invertebrate zoology) of different species (about 150) are placed very close to a seal, a turtle and some sea sponges.

The frescoed rooms of the gallery, which was created in 1829, offer an enchanting walk through the collection of a 19th-century gentleman and a fine example of neoclassical taste. The centrepieces of the collection are two rare works by Antonio Canova, a longstanding friend of Count Tadini, namely a terracotta model entitled Religion and the marble Tadini Tombstone in the chapel in the middle of the garden.
The Greek and Roman antiquities and the items of porcelain, including an epergne by Filippo Tagliolini with a depiction of the Judgment of Paris, recall the Count's visit to Naples in the last decade of his life. Similarly, the delicate French china recalls his stay in Paris, where he met Napoleon.
The suppression of numerous religious institutions made it possible to purchase masterpieces in Venice, including a Madonna and Child by Jacopo Bellini, in Verona (works by Francesco Benaglio, Domenico Brusasorci and Bernardino India), and in Cremata, including altarpieces by Vincenzo Civerchio and Paris Bordon.

The objects, documents, photographs, oral testimonies presented here illustrate the arduous and painstaking work that the structural and environmental conditions have forced the inhabitants of the Valley of Scalve: the stone placed at the beginning of the exhibition, furrowed by deep passage of the sleds loaded with minerals that ""Strusì"" transported to the valley bottom, is a prime example. The museum is not, therefore, the container for a collection of objects coated by time, but overall a path that represents the essential characteristics of society and economy of the Valley, captured through the material culture.

For later years the house would have different properties until the Barone Giovanni Maria Scotti, from whom, in 1925, the future pope ,would rent a few rooms to do as his summer residence. In 1959, the noble family, Scotti Guffanti, presented the new Pope of the rooms he had once occupied , while the Italian Government bought the entire complex and it's surroundings to create a ""House of Memories"", attached to the Institute of the Suore delle Poverelle who would restored and adapt the complex for this Pope.
A visit to Camaitino begins with the entrance hall and the various rooms on the ground floor, which holds documents (remembrances, memorabilia, souvenirs), of the life and activity of Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli. In particular, the first floor contains the office, dining room and the bedroom from the Apostolic Palace of the Vaticano, in which Blessed John XXIII died . In addition, it contains part of the Pontifical Chapel. Once also visit the oratory at Camaitino, blessed in 1991. The Museum collectives the object of uninterrupted pilgrimage by people from many parts of the world. Among the many notable objects in the collection the bronze works of Giacomo Manzù.

          The Marta Pozzebon in Girotto Museum was born from the passion of a monk, Father Mansueto Girotto. In the 70s he carried out a journey through the memory of traditional jobs of the farms of Lombardy and Veneto. The attention is mainly focused on silkworm processing which marked the economy of many farming families until the late '60s. A job involving women and children, who literally put their house at the disposal of these valuable guests for two months every year. The museum runs through all the different stages of processing: from the maturation of eggs in handmade incubators to the collection and shredding of mulberry leaves to feed the larvae, to the setting up of a canopy to house the ""sleeping"" and ""dumb"" maggots, to heather and willow branches where the precious insects begin to spin the cocoon. Here the work of nature combines with culture: the cocoons are collected, cleaned, treated to prevent their metamorphosis; the fray of the cocoon is carried out to get the skein, as well as the weaving, and many handmade items are displayed.

It is located in an area particularly ""inspired"" to visual communication. The ancient ""art"" of the Camonica Valley, with its rock engravings, inaugurated a graphical representation imprinted and ""printed"" on the stone.
It then became an educational method for personal growth thanks to the intuition of the Blessed Priest Lodovico Pavoni, from Brescia, who was the first in Italy to found a printing school in 1821. The ""typographical sign"" is all of that, this museum is much more than a simple display of objects and equipment, but an active memory of what was and it must be the typographic culture.
A ""typographical sign"" that aims to consider a deeper mark than ink on paper, an imprint of education and training to the good taste, order and aesthetics.

The museum, because of his geographical position in an area rich in Bronze Age evidences, offers a wide survey of the prehistoric cultures of the Benacense district.
The exceptionality of this region, probably one of the most important in Europe in regard to the archaeological humid areas, comes from human deposits, nowadays submerged and set not far from the lake's shore or stratified in the peats of the inframorainic basins.
The museum highlight is a plough made of oak, dating back to Early Bronze Age (ca. 2000 BC), discovered in a peat layer in 1978, stuck between the piles of a Lavagnone pile-dwelling. 
The museum is situated in the cloister of an ex-monastry (S. Maria del Carmine, 1472, Bearfooted Carmelitans Order). The contiguous church, nowadays deconsecrated, was named after S. Maria de Senioribus. 
The cloister, rectangular in shape with 5 arches on each side end 20 columns, was finished al least in 1547. The building, now of public property, was renovated in1984.

The museum is divided into various sections, focusing primarily on the history of the Como area as illustrated by archaeological items since the earliest traces of human occupation.
The prehistoric and protohistoric section provides as particularly well documented overview of the Golasecca culture, which developed in the area of Como in the first millennium BC. 
The Roman section presents material from the town of Novum Comum, founded by Julius Caesar, and illustrates the most salient aspects of the everyday life of the time.

          Inaugurated on 4 October 1990, the Museo Didattico della seta presents an array of equipment, tools, documents and fabric samples bearing witness to the tradition of textile production that made Como the Italian city of silk. This truly unique museum of machinery is a place of culture with a complete, educational programme accessible to all. The initial project, focused on equipment, has been developed through refurbishment and the creation of new exhibition rooms, a multimedia library and new services in such a way as to harness the collections of artefacts, fabrics, samples and technical drawings built up over the years and expanded by numerous donations. 
Como alone can display the processing of the precious material that generated its wealth and charm because Como alone has such a history of silk manufacture and culture developed through the extraordinary skills of its artisans and industry from 1850 to 1950.
While opening its doors to the general public and organizing specific exhibitions in the field of textile production, the museum is involved in the purchasing, restoration and maintenance of new items capable of illustrating the various phases of silk manufacture and hence performing an educational function aimed at deeper understanding. It has also produced its own documentation, in particular a general catalogue in Italian and English and a short guide, which prove very useful to the many foreign visitors and students that pour in every year.

          Our Physics Laboratory was first started By Alessandro Volta in 1775; he was headmaster and teacher of Physics in the school, located at the time in the previous Jesus College. The first machines date back to 1793. Between 1804 and 1818 Swiss neoclassic architect Simone Cantoni transformed the Monastery of S. Cecilia into a building suitable to host the present Lyceum and the town cultural facilities; a library, a botanic garden and an art gallery, on the model of Brera.
The Physics Laboratory (today a library) resembles the Pantheon with its large vault, circular at the top. In 1838 opposite the church, the Laboratory of Natural Sciences was equipped, today in need of repairs. Today the Museum of Physics can be found in the northern part of the Lyceum, built between 1820 and1824 by Swiss architect Biagio Magistretti.
The instruments donated by G: B: Gattoni, a friend of Volta's, make up the heart of the collection.

The museum was completely renovated in 1999, creating a path that goes backwards in time from the modern times to the geological ages. The main stages of the local history and prehistory and of the ""Larian Triangle"" are documented in the eight rooms of the museum. The outfit of Canzo tombs (Copper Age and Bronze Age), a lombardian sword with silver damascening decorated handle and a map from Teresian times are the main and most precious finds. 
In the courtyard there are two ""massi-avello"" (tombs excavated in erratic rock, dating back to the IV century and the VI century AC, spread in the ""Larian Triangle"" and the Canton Ticino) and some sarcophagus with relative roofs upon.

          The new Archaeological Museum is located in St. Lorenzo's basilical church and in the annexed Meli chapel, dating back to the 15th century. It displays what is considered the core of the Cremona archaeological collection: through the findings discovered since the 19th century up to the recent excavation in piazza Marconi, it allows to reconstruct the image of the town founded by the Romans in 218 b.C., the first one northern than the Po river. The museum building is Romanesque and it rises from the ruins of a previous church (10th century), in the site once occupied by a late Republican Roman necropolis, which coasted the first suburban portion of the Postumia street, and by a funerary Early Christian church: thus the building is itself an archaeological site, where the remains are still in great measure visible.

          The main part of the Ala Ponzone City Museum was created thanks to a donation by the marquis Ala Ponzone (1842) and has been enriched with works from former churches and successive legacies. Since 1928 it has been based in Palazzo Affaitati, an example of 16th century Cremonese architecture. The picture gallery is currently being prepared, with works by mainly Cremona artists from the 15th to the 20th centuries but there are also works by famous painters such as Caravaggio and Arcimboldi. There are also oriental pottery, enamel and ivory objects. Special areas have been created for the most important cultural events of the town.

The Stradivari Museum, housed in the noble, eighteenth-century rooms of the Palazzo Affaitati, is organised in three sections:
- an itinerary that explains the construction of a contralto viola in accordance with the tradition of the classical Cremonese school; the equipment for the contralto viola of 1690 was chosen for this first section, as it is one of the most complete sets among those kept within the museum; the itinerary has also been studied and organised for the blind and those with poor eyesight;
- the group of instruments which represents mainly Italian violin makers active from the second half of the 19th century to the first half of the 20th century;
- the Salabue-Fiorini Collection, displayed in sixteen showcases containing 710 artefacts, originating from the workshop of Antonio Stradivari.

          The Natural History Museum is situated inside a park with local botanical specimens, varied wildlife and a small ""lake"" which is becoming a natural habitat.
The museum was bequeathed by Ala Ponzone and is particularly interesting as Giuseppe Sigismondo (1761-1842) was also a naturalist. Other donated collections, above all from local naturalists, were added. The suggested itinerary is in sections, one historical, a systematic passage through the individual disciplines of mineralogy, palaeontology and zoology and at last a perusal of the local area.
The surroundings, natural and urban, allow two other locally linked themes to be added: a display of ""the town upside down"" and a reflection on bio-diversity preservation.

          The Museum, opened in 1988, is located in a building dating back to the 15th century. Didactic demonstrations give an overview of the fascinating world of books and printing and of the typographic technique used - beginning with the invention of movable types in the 15th century. The Museum is dedicated to the Soncino family of Jewish printers, which was active in the duchy of the Sforzas between 1483 and 1490 and produced valuable editions, mainly in Hebraic, among which the first edition of the Hebraic Bible completed with vowel signs. Later the Soncinos moved to other Italian towns, they also printed texts in Latin and Italian and then they migrated to the East, to Salonicco and Istambul. The Museum offers evidence of the ancient typographic art: it shows the functioning of a printing machine, illustrates the composition of the page elements with movable types, the inking and printing processes. Printing machines going back to the 18th and 19th centuries, in-depth studies of Jewish printing, original prints and reprints and a didactic video complete the exhibition. The Museum also houses didactic lithography workshops and temporary exhibitions.

          In the 1818 Pietro Monti, throwster, came to Abbadia Lariana from Milan. He transformed the old building for felting wool into a place for the production of silk. In 1869 he enlarged the building and he added a new one for the spinning of cocoon; the first of the two spinning machines was demolished and in its place three rectangular spinning machines were built. The second circular spinning machine, which hadn't been working since 1934, was bought by the Abegg family. It was dismantled and offered to the Technorama Museum of Winterhurt in the 1965. Throwing activity lasted until 1934. After a period of standstill and degradation, the town council of Abbadia bought the building in 1978. The works of restoration of buildings and of the spinning machine started in 1981, though passing through several hard moments. The circular spinning machine of 1818 can still work. 
In the 1998 the Museo Setificio Monti was finally opened. The museum is composed by the Monti complex: the spinning machine of 1818 and the spinning mill of 1869. The complex is composed by 2 buildings, one with the spinning machine-winder, the other one with the spinning mill and its activities. Before the restoration works started, there were nothing left of spinning mill building, while there were still the three rectangular spinning machines and 15% of the circular spinning machine. Besides the ruins of same auxiliary machine, there are two hydraulic wheels with the irrigation ditch.

After a few years the students had become so numerous as to force the artist to ask the local municipality for a larger space. He was granted the premises of an old Art Nouveau building, where in the early nineties the Museum Folligeniali was founded, then refurbished and completely renovated in 2009. The museum collects works by artists of the Bergognone school of art, who have embraced Frosio's slogan: ""Art is...to love."" But the exhibits are not made in the mold of the master: there are as many styles as there are people and creative ways, each implemented in accordance with a rigorous method, but in an atmosphere of total freedom of expression.

          The Museo Boschi-Di Stefano presents an extraordinary collection of 20th-century Italian art donated to the city of Milan in 1974 by Antonio Boschi and Marieda Di Stefano, who embellished their apartment on Via Giorgio Jan all through their married life with innumerable masterpieces of painting, sculpture and drawing from period between the 1900s and the 1960s. 
Located in a building of the 1930s designed by Piero Portaluppi, the apartment was inaugurated as a museum in 2003 after renovation of the premises undertaken by the City Council and refurbishment for display purposes by the Boschi-Di Stefano Foundation. The rooms of the apartment thus became the ideal space to exhibit a selection of the over 200 works in the collection. 
Part of the collection has been on show at the Museo del Novecento since December 2010 in order to highlight the key role of private collectors in the creation of municipal collections.

          The Castello Sforzesco Photographic Archives is one of the greatest in Italy by virtue of the quality and quality of the material held, the specific nature of the subject matter and the importance of the photographers included. Founded at the beginning of the 20th century, it now possesses approximately 850,000 original photographs ranging in time from 1840 to the present. The images captured by major Italian and foreign photographers using a whole variety of particular photographic and printing techniques include slices of social history, ways of life, portraits of famous people, natural landscapes, episodes of urban transformation especially in Milan (the rebuilding of the Castello Sforza), precious items of artistic heritage, and series devoted to travels in the East during the 19th century (the Ottoman Empire, India, China and Japan) and historical events (the Roman Republic of 1849, the Crimean War of 1855, the Milanese riots of 1898).
The sections of greatest historical importance include the Luca Beltrami Collection, the Iconographic Collection and the Lamberto Vitali Collection.
The archives is today involved in projects for the conservation, restoration, scientific cataloguing and digital acquisition of the images so as to make its holdings more readily accessible also via computer. The photographic collections are entirely available on a daily basis to the public in the reading room, which periodically hosts lectures and exhibitions on the history of photography. 
The archives also has an organized collection of specialized publications and periodicals, the catalogue of which is now accessible on the OPAC (On-line Public Access Catalogue) of the Lombardy Region through the SBN (national library) network. In addition to specialized and often hard to find books on the history and technique of photography, the library includes a rare collection of 19th century sales catalogues of photographic studies (including Alinari, Brogi and Anderson in particular).

          Founded in 1955, the Gallery of Contemporary Religious Art is the first museum of its kind in Italy and among the firsts in the world. It was founded by Dandolo Bellini, a painter and collector, in the halls of eighteenth-century Villa Clerici (Milan) in the Casa di Redenzione Sociale, an institute dedicated to the recovery of children in distress, with the dual task of educating through art and fundraising. The Gallery was repeatedly visited by Giovanni Battista Montini, Milan's archbishop, who here said that he ""had reconciled with modern art"". The experience of Montini at Villa Clerici is the basis of the turn made by him as Pope Paul VI in the relationship between the Church and contemporary artistic expressions, culminated with the opening of the Gallery of Modern Art in the Vatican Museums, to whose creation he called Bellini himself. The list of the artists includes Libero Andreotti, Dina Bellotti, Floriano Bodini, Ettore Calvelli, Felice Carena, Aldo Carpi, Virginio Ciminaghi, Silvio Consadori, Pericle Fazzini, Trento Longaretti, Francesco Messina, Luciano Minguzzi, Lello Scorzelli, Alberto Sughi, Valentino Vago, Giuseppe Zigaina.

          The ""Museo d'Arte e Scienza"" was opened in 1990 under the name ""Musei Didattici"" (Teaching Museums). The Museum's founder was Gottfried Matthaes, a German physicist belonging to a family of longstanding artistic tradition, who died last year at the age of 90. At the end of World War II he inherited the teaching collections used by the school of painting founded in Dresden in 1906 by the Matthaes-Kurau couple. Being himself an avid art lover and collector, Matthaes decided to acquire exhibition space in the Palazzo Bonacossa, just opposite the Sforzesco Castle, where visitors can admire numerous antiques selected not for their beauty but for their didactic value with the aim of helping them to tell ""fake"" from authentic antiques. The Museum's own internal scientific laboratory also devotes itself to the ascertainment of the authenticity of art works and the dating of wooden artefacts, issuing certificates for public entities and private collectors alike.
Moreover, two of the Museum's rooms house a rich collection of Buddhist art objects entitled ""East Asian Buddhist Art"", and there is also an outstanding collection of African masks and sculptures (currently closed to the public for renovation work) constituting the second section dedicated to non-European cultures. The Museum has recently begun staging cultural events and series of conferences on specific themes, like the coming exhibition ""Fragments of Japan"", organized in collaboration between the association ""Japan in Italy"" and the association ""Friends of the Museo d'Arte e Scienza"".

          The combined home and museum created by the Milanese collector Gian Giacomo Poldi Pezzoli is known all over the world.
Poldi Pezzoli was born in Milan in 1822. His father Giuseppe inherited great wealth from both his father's family, the Poldi of Parma, and his mother's, the Pezzoli d'Albertone of Bergamo. Rosa Trivulzio, his mother, belonged to one of the oldest Milanese families with a long tradition of collecting, for which Gian Giacomo soon developed a passion. He began building up his extraordinary art collection in the 1840s, not only paintings (including masterpieces by Pollaiolo, Botticelli, Giovanni Bellini, Mantegna, Piero della Francesca, Tiepolo and Guardi) but also sculptures and important items of the decorative arts, armour and weapons, glassware, ceramics, jewellery, solar and mechanical clocks, carpets and furniture.
At the same time, Poldi Pezzoli used his money and energy in the refurbishment of his apartment in accordance with the taste of the age, calling in the leading artists and decorators for the purpose. This was the undertaking of a lifetime, which ended in 1879 with the collector's sudden death. The museum opened to the public in 1881 in accordance with his wishes. It is one of Italy's earliest artistic foundations and still maintains all the interest and atmosphere of a combined home and museum despite the damage suffered during World War II. 
In addition to the evocative historical rooms in the 19th-century style, visitors should take in those recently redesigned for display purposes, namely the weapons room designed by the artist Arnaldo Pomodoro (2000), the room of gold (2006) and the collector's room.
The strong ties that have always existed between the museum and collectors are demonstrated by a series of important donations over the years, including solar and mechanical clocks, lace and embroidery, drawings and paintings, china and netsuke. 
The museum organizes exhibitions, lectures, courses, concerts with ancient musical instruments and activities for schools and families. 
The aids available to the public include catalogues, educational publications, free audio guides for adults and children, and a museum shop. 
The Museo Poldi Pezzoli is on facebook and files can be downloaded from www.museopoldipezzoli.it for smartphones.

          The story of the Museo Teatrale alla Scala started in 1911, when Duke Uberto Visconti di Modrone, Professor Lodovico Pagliaghi, the composer and librettist Arrigo Boito, the correspondent of Il Secolo Mr Borsa, Senator Mangili, Count Leopoldo Pullè and Gino (Ettore) Modigliani, director of the Pinacoteca di Brera gathered around a table of the Teatro alla Scala.
Who were these men? They were the most prominent people of Milan in those years. Most of them were exponents of the rich cultural community of the city and were connected to the Teatro alla Scala by their love and passion. The decision to be taken around that table concerned the purchase of the theatre collection belonging to the antique dealer Giulio Sambon that was going to be put up for auction in Paris on the very first days of May of the same year. Those antiques could have been the starting point of a huge theatre collection whose foundation had been sought for a very long time by the Milanese intellectual community close to La Scala, since the very first years of the century.
But the auction of the precious collection was forthcoming: how was it possible to find the necessary funds in one week only? With the help of the government and 50 citizens, who subscribed 5,000 liras of that time each, after a series of incredible adventures to wring the collection out of the American multimillionaire J.P. Morgan, the dream came true and the collection was then given to the city of Milan.
The Museum was officially inaugurated on 8 March 1913 with a solemn ceremony in the former Casino Ricordi connected to the Teatro alla Scala. Over the years numerous donations and purchases added to the Sambon collection, which is today one of the richest and most envied collections in the world. The most important deposits are in the ""Casa di riposo per musicisti"" (retirement-home for musicians) founded by Giuseppe Verdi, as well as in public places. The Museum also includes the Library, founded with its present structure with the 40,000 volumes given in 1952 by Renato Simoni, author and critic of the Corriere della Sera who wanted it to be dedicated to his mother Livia, and which is continuously enriched and updated.

          The residential complex on Via Mozart was designed in the early 1930s by the Milanese architect Piero Portaluppi for Angelo Campiglio, his wife Gigina Necchi and her sister Nedda, typical figures in the upper middle class of the Lombardy region.
In addition to the villa itself and its grounds, the luxurious residential complex designed by Portaluppi down to the smallest detail in complete architectural freedom include the porter's lodge, conservatory, garages, swimming pool and tennis court.
What makes the Villa Necchi Campiglio so extraordinary in the history of Lombard architecture is above all the coherent harmony established between the exterior of the building, the architectural elements of the garden and even the smallest decorative details of the interior, from the mouldings of the ceilings to the gate of the tennis courts and the radiator covers.
The house on Via Mozart still bears faithful witness to this privileged lifestyle both in its intact architectural structure and in the history of its furnishings, collections and utensils, which have been handed down over the generations unchanged and are extraordinarily well preserved. 
Two important donations make a visit still more rewarding, namely Claudia Gian Ferrari's collection of early 20th-century works of art and the collection of 18th-century paintings and decorative art of Alighiero and Emilietta de' Micheli.
The quantity and quality of the works of art in the Villa Necchi Campiglio make it an authentic museum of decorative art. We refer in particular to the outstanding Louis XV furniture, 19th-century English silverware, Brussels tapestries and numerous objects of Eastern art in bronze and porcelain.
Everything in the house today has remained as its owners wished and left it. Alongside the architectural structures and furnishings, the objects of everyday use play a very important part in preserving the domestic atmosphere intact almost seventy years on.

The museum brings together, catalogues, conserves, and displays cultural evidence - ranging from archaeological finds to historical-artistic artefacts, from videos to oral traditions - in order to weave around these an evocative and scientifically valid narrative of the local culture and history.
A narrative which becomes the tool through which complex contents, such as a work of art or a historical document, are translated into a language which is both popular and topical.
The collections are displayed on two floors consisting of 14 rooms in total. The ground floor is organised chronologically starting with the Roman Ages to the 19th Century while the first floor is organised on the whole thematically concentrating on contemporary history.

          The museum, belonging to Banca Popolare di Sondrio, is dedicated to Carlo Donegani (1775-1845), the engineer who planned the Stelvio Pass road.
The exhibition area consists of three sections. In the most important, dedicated to the ""Great War"", there are panels with period photos and notes in Italian and German as well as a showcase with a great collection of relics - found and donated by Mario Pasinetti - dating back to the war time.
There is also a fragment of trench which was made using finds from the fighting places. This section is the ideal starting point (or point of arrival) for visiting a wider and more suggestive Museum: the open-air Museum consisting of a close network of bays, fortifications and trenches.
A section of the area commemorates the work of the engineer Donegani and it collects copy of the original technical and historical documents concerning his road plan.
The Stelvio carriageway was commissioned by the Imperial Royal Government of Lombardy-Venetia and it was built just in five years (1820-1825). 
The last section is dedicated to the events which contributed to make the Stelvio Pass famous: events concerning snow sports, cycling, mountain-climbing, motorcycling and motor-racing.

          The Museo Civico dei Fossili di Besano is home to a wonderful and unique collection of fossils that were collected in the rocks outcropping in the mountains surrounding Besano, one of the most classic paleontological sites in Italy. The fossils of Besano have been studied by paleontologist from all over the world since the first of 19th century, as they include a great variety of species of terrestrial plants, invertebrates, fishes and both terrestrial and marine reptiles. The fossiliferous rocks of Besano are Middle Triassic in age (about 235 million years ago); the Triassic Period represent the first part of the Mesozoic Era, during which dinosaurs, pterosaurs and ichthyosaurs made their appearance along with turtles and crocodiles.
The exhibits of the Museum were recently completely renovated and uptodated. In five exhibit halls the most exceptional findings are displayed, most of which were collected during excavations carried on in Besano over the last twenty five years. Among them is the impressive and unique, complete skeleton of the large ichthyosaur Besanosaurus leptorhynchus. The specimen is about 6 metres long. So far largest complete Mesozoic reptile ever found in Italy.
The Museum housed also the cast of the remains of the big Theropod ""Saltriosaurus"" at today the only Lower Giurassic dinosaur discovered in Italy.
The Museum also features a small laboratory for educational activities, and a special area is designed for the projection of a video explaining the history of paleontological discoveries and excavations in Besano. The design of exhibits, field excavations, and scientific research are pursued in collaboration with the Paleontological Department of the Museo Civico di Storia Naturale di Milano.

          One of the most famous fresco cycle of the early Renaissance, painted by Masolino da Panicale: its scenes cover entirely the walls of the Baptistery annexed to the Collegiate Church of Castiglione Olona, that was also decorated by Masolino, assisted by Lorenzo di Pietro called il Vecchietta and by Paolo Schiavo. The religious complex was ordered by Cardinal Branda Castiglioni, who, at the beginning of the 15th century, made Castiglione Olona, following the famous definition of the Italian poet Gabriele D'Annunzio, ""the Tuscan island in Lombardy"".
Masolino's refined frescoes, with their balance of landscapes and architectures, religious history and 15th century fashion, blended through the painter's peculiar luminous atmosphere, witness the transition between International Gothic and Renaissance, thus offering an extremely suggestive account of one of the most relevant periods of Italian art history.

Some of the large canvases created in the 1920s are on permanent view. In the other three rooms works are exhibited on a rotating basis according to specific themes or temporary exhibitions of other artists are held. On the external walls of the building there are frescoes by Salvini (recently restored) and by the painters Rossi and Minoretti. The mill structure made up of two runners and two bedstones, restored in 1998 thanks to the European project Hidràulic, is in working order.
""Colour was music, imagination, drawing was form, an open question about mankind and the world. A question which becomes knowledge but pauses on the threshold of judgement. Salvini's figures (normally his relatives) are not rendered in their social context, they wait in the sunlight. They seem to contemplate the sky, absorbed in an elementary meditation. They are static and will not blunder when getting back in touch with mankind; if we were to indulge in rethoric, we could affirm that the figures drawn by the Christian artist Salvini were longing to discover the divine, beyond sun and space"" (Raffaele De Grada, ""Dall'istinto al pensiero: l'arte di Innocente Salvini"", Grafica Varese Edizioni, 2001).

In 1954, with its first archaeological exhibition the museum was officially established. Nowadays the museum is housed in the 19th century town hall building of Sesto Calende and exhibits, in a modern display, archaeological finds of the Golasecca Culture which flourished in North-Western Italy during the last millennium B.C. 
The objects on display were found in the areas of Golasecca, Sesto Calende and Castelletto sopra Ticino; they are exhibited chronologically and supplied with broad and explicative didactic-type notices, including several illustrations and pictures in order to make them easily and pleasantly understandable. 
The Golasecca Culture is represented by several funerary objects from different necropolis, suggesting both a high demographic concentration and a diversified, evolved society. The Golasecca Culture has been the commercial and cultural intermediary between the Etruscan world, central Italy and the Transalpine world. The few finds brought to light concerning the inhabited areas relate to common working activities (kilns, querns, weaving tools, etc.) and bear evidence of hut flooring and cobbled paving. 
Recently, finds belonging to the ""Bellini Collection"" have been acquired. 
The museum also displays considerable objects of the roman period and the San Donato Abbey group of pluteus, dating from the early Middle Ages. 
There is an interesting collection of marine fossils from Cheglio di Taino, which has recently been classified by computer.

Many works that were made specifically for rooms of the villa in the 70s (such as Dan Flavin's permanent site specific installation Varese Corridor), priceless pieces of Italian Renaissance furniture and a collection of tribal art are also on view in the villa. The Italian-Style superb garden offers a spectacular viewpoint from which visitors can enjoy the panorama of the Italian Alps.

 from churches throughout the area, especially from the convent of San 
Francesco, and came into the town’s possession following the suppression
 of religious orders. There are archaeological finds, furniture, 
sculptures, liturgical objects, besides paintings dating mainly from the
 seventeenth century. Of great value is the canvas of the Immaculate 
Conception, by Flemish painter Ernst Van Schayck, dated 1631. There are 
also a significant number of works from private collections or produced 
by artists from Montelupone. The museum itinerary is completed by visits
 to the perfectly preserved 1300-1400s town centre, to the San Francesco
 and collegiate churches, where there are two rare altarpieces by the 
sixteenth-century painter Antonio da Faenza, and to the Museo di Arti e

The room antecedent to the Tempietto Rossiniano (the Marble Room) portrays the birth and historical events of the community of Pesaro.

The complex represents the tangible example of a culture’s architectural evolution. In this group of properties, there are two types of buildings: one, more recently, spread over two floors with a tall, narrow facade topped by a triangular pediment; the other which represents the older part, is formed by simple organisms of small dimensions, for the most part single-celled, and equipped with characteristic elements of typical trullo construction. Contrary of the most modern part, in fact, in these areas the walls are formed by non square stones positioned randomly. In 1986, the complex was purchased by the town of Alberobello and between 1993 and 1997, was restored to its original state.

The Albea wine cellar (Albea was the ancient name of Alberobello) was built in 1905. The structure is built with stone, the tanks used to contain the wine are buried in the rock and were once also intended to supply water to cisterns of trulli. The special attention placed in the construction of the wine cellar (that it should not be a simple production structure but also a beautiful building in accordance with the surrounding environment) is showed in the elegant and sober interior design which echoes a mosque, including vaulted ceilings joined at the top with main pillars, formed by overlaid rocky boulders and leaks modeled with layers of red clay. The purpose of the Museum is to disseminate the knowledge of wine and a farming world made with passion, an inexhaustible heritage of culture and civilization. "

The first attempt to create a botanical garden in Bari was in August of 1813.Aa decree of Gioacchino Murat decreed that each provincial capital should have a Society of Agriculture (later called Economic Society) with adjoining garden for the testing and production of agricultural and ornamental plants. This botanical garden was short-lived, because the return of the Bourbon king of Naples forced the company to leave its seat and move to a provisional place. In 1858, after long disputes, the City of Bari granted a soil of 52 “moggie” near the coast, where he erected the building of the Economic Society with an adjoining garden. This second attempt failed as a result of the annexation of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies to the Kingdom of Italy. Then, by the decree of Victor Emanuel II of 11 February 1886, the Company was finally abolished. In 1964, a few years after the founding of the Institute, there was a doubling of the surface of the Garden up to 10,000 sqm. The new area was organized according to the ecological system, giving priority to regional flora including aquatic plants. "

had a new building in Piazza Indipendenza: it was planned by Dionigi Scano, and
the curator of the exhibition was the famous archaeologist Antonio Taramelli,
superintendent from 1901 to 1931. After many donations and a large number of
materials coming from the excavations, in 1993 the museum was transferred to
its final location in the Cittadella dei Musei, in a building planned by the
architects Piero Gazzola and Libero Cecchini in the area of the eighteenth-
century Regio Arsenale. </span></p>

<p class=""MsoBodyText"" style=""line-height:normal""><span style=""mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"" lang=""EN-GB"">The museum is laid out over four floors, with a
chronological excursus through prehistory and the ancient history of Sardinia.
A subterranean room displays finds from the Ancient Neolithic (around 6000-4000
BC) to the Early Middle Ages (8th century AD). On the other floors, the most
important archaeological sites of middle and south Sardinia are documented
during five main periods: the Prenuragic Age, with finds from the Neolithic,
Eneolithic Age (6000-1800 BC) and the Early Bronze Age (1800-1600 BC); the
Nuragic period, with materials dating to the Middle Bronze (1600-1300 BC) and
the Iron Age (600 BC); the Phoenician- Punic period (second half of the 8th
century BC-238 BC); the Republican and Imperial Roman Age (end of the 3rd
century BC- first half of the 4th century AD) and finally the Late Roman Age
and the Early Middle Ages (until the 7th- 8th century AD).</span></p>

Pinacoteca Nazionale di Cagliari (National Art Gallery) is placed within the
Cittadella dei Musei in a valuable building planned in the second half of the
20th century in the area of the Regio Arsenale, in the ancient quarter of
Castello. At the end of the 19th century, the Pinacoteca Nazionale was in the
Palazzo delle Seziate in piazza Indipendenza, then it was closed to the public
in the mid-70s and finally in 1992 it was moved to its final location in a
building (planned by the architect Piero Gazzola) which englobes part of the
Spanish sixteenth- century wall, in a connection between the ancient and the
modern. From here, on the top of the Cittadella, you enjoy a beautiful view on
the city of Cagliari. </span></p>

3318,106484,traduzioni_descrizione,en,"The Compendio Garibaldino opened to the
 public in 1976 and it is the most visited museum in Sardinia. A large area, set
 in the uncontaminated nature of the island, holds the buildings and relics that
 belonged to Giuseppe Garibaldi- who lived here during the last 25 years of his
 life- or acquired after his death (1882). The main residence is the “casa
 bianca” (white house), built in 1856-1857, which is made of seven &nbsp;connecting rooms: atrium, three
 bedrooms, study, dining-room and kitchen. One more room was added later, the
 “camera della morte” (room of the death), where Garibaldi used to receive his
 relatives and friends. Relics of his life when he was a combatant, personal
 mementos, objects of Garibaldi and his relatives and the original furniture
 recall the daily life of the hero, his last partner Francesca Armosino and
 their two sons, Clelia, the elder – who lived here until 1959, when she died-
 and Manlio, passionately fond of sea, suddenly dead of tuberculosis when he was
 26. The Compendio holds other buildings, too, as the “casa di legno” (wooden
 house), the “casa di ferro” (iron house)- that keeps the library of the General
 and his lineal descendants- the oil-press, the oven, the stable and the mill,
 all built by Garibaldi, his son Menotti and his closest collaborators. In the
 middle of the farm is a graveyard, with the granite tomb of the General, his
 third wife Francesca Armosino and his sons Manlio, Clelia, Rosa, Anita and
 Teresita."

This idea originated from the research carried out by the students and staff of Scuola Media Statale at Ales between 1993-1996.The toys are faithful replicas of the original home made ones, they are imbued with the authentic folk spirit and, just like in the past, they are made strictly from material found in the surrounding environment.This is the only collection of the type of toys which were once found all over Sardinia. The toys are grouped according to special themes: transport, festivals, dolls, toys that improve ability in racing and throwing, a wide display of weapons, various pastimes and games, objects for the production of sounds and other objects used in games.The simple base of reed or other woven plants on which the toys are set enhances their effect.</div><div><br></div>"

3345,106483,traduzioni_descrizione,en,"The museum opened to the public in 2008 in the former Jesuit College
of the Canopoleno, an historical building in the centre of Sassari built by the
archbishop of Oristano Antonio Canopolo between the end of the 16th and the
beginning of the 17th century. Acquired by the State in the first half of the
19th century, the building was restored in the 90s of the 20th century to hold
the valuable state artistic patrimony received through donations and bequests.
The Pinacoteca shows the art collections Sanna and Tomè (this last previously
kept in the storehouses of the National Archaeological Museum G.A. Sanna) and a
large number of works, including ten contemporary paintings acquired with the
Panicali Battaglia donation. The patrimony of the museum is mafe up of more
than 490 paintings, sculptures and artefacts dating from a period between the
Medieval age and the mid- twentieth century, related to different schools and
local, Italian and European artists from the end of the 14th century. Worth mentioning are the triptych by Mariotto di Nardo from Florence
(documented between 1394 and 1424), the works by the so- called Maestro di
Ozieri (half of the 16th century) and the Maddalena by Andrea Vaccaro
from Naples (1604-1670). The most significant sections
are dedicated to nineteenth/early twentieth- century Sardinian artists (Giovanni Marghinotti, the largest collection in
Sardinia, Antonio Ballero, Filippo Figari, Giuseppe Biasi, Carmelo Floris,
Pietro Antonio Manca, Mario Delitala, Stanis Dessy, Eugenio Tavolara), and a
graphic section with valuable works by Giuseppe Biasi and Stanis Dessy.

Now the museum is being restored, so only a selection of
seventeenth/eighteenth- century works, divided by chronology and theme, are
exhibited. Nevertheless the most important paintings are visible on the museum
web site."

3802,100512,traduzioni_descrizione,en,"In the Aldein Museum, the visitor finds sacred art which reflects 
religious and secular forms of art from the Baroque and Rococo eras. In 
2000, the little museum was expanded with paintings, wood carvings, 
coins, and medallions from private collections. Since its opening in 
1990, the Aldein Museum has grown continuously. In the meantime, the 
Museum Society has come to operate three museums in different locations 
within the community with varying opening hours. In the Mill Museum, 
technical cultural assets from rural everyday life are looked after and 
the use of water power is introduced. In the “Thalmühle” mill, grain is 
ground into flour, while in the “Matznellermühle”, mill, grain and wool 
are pressed. In the smithy addition, visitors can at times also try 
their hands at the art of forging. Of particular interest is the 
“Schiaßermühl” mill. This is where school children from Aldein can make 
their own marbles out of two or three-colored sandstone. The Geomusuem 
in Radein (Radengo), opened in 2004, is devoted to one of the most 
superb and geologically interesting gorges in South Tyrol and, indeed, 
all of Europe. Along with the Geoparc visitor’s center, it presents the 
origin of the Bletterbach Gorge, a three kilometer (2 mile) long 
accessible canyon with volcanic and sedimentary rock. A visit to the 
Geomuseum, newly renovated in 2006, is an ideal addition to a hike along
 the Bletterbach."

&#13;
The Museo Archeologico e Foro Romano is located in the most central area of Assisi, the museum site extends under the current Piazza del Comune, which is the city’s focal point from where—still today—the Minerva Roman Temple dominates, and on which the facades of the most important medieval buildings of the town overlook.&#13;
The archaeological area corresponds to the so-called Central Terrace, one of the monumental platforms realized in the 2nd century BC, in the context of the planning of the Roman town of Asisium. The terrace that for the centrality of its position is traditionally considered to be the Forum of the town, is dominated by the overbearing Temple of Minerva, which is one of the few Roman religious architectural constructions to remain intact; it is still visible on the Northern side of the square.&#13;
The itinerary, currently called “A Journey To the Ancient Square of Assisi”, starts from the former Crypt of San Nicolò, which is the site from where the majority of all town and surrounding territorial archaeological finds—epigraphs and urns discovered since the 19th century—come from. Going through a corridor, with a transparent glass pavement from which the visitor can appreciate the original Roman pavement below, skirting the Temple’s terraced wall, there is a monumental inscription commemorating the 30 B.C. works held under the care of the “Quattuorviri”—the ancient Roman supreme magistrates who ran the Asisium Municipality. Along the opposite wall, the funerary steles and—at a short distance, at the end of a short passage—a large pedestal in which the statues of the Dioscuri, Castor and Pollux—sons of Jupiter—used to stand, are arranged. Going on, a little further, the visitor reaches a vaulted hall, the Sala delle Volte, in which restored marble statues—among them one of the half-naked male characters of the 1st century A.D. found in the excavation area—are arranged."

Reopened to the public in 2005, the Gallery is hosted by the Pro Civitate Cristiana, an association of laics founded in 1939 by Father Giovanni Rossi. Its purpose was that of promoting catholic culture in contemporary society.&#13;
The first nucleus of the collection exhibits the works that were part of Personal Exhibitions of Christian Art during the aftermath of the Second World War. Later, initiatives such as a number of commissions dedicated to the Iconography of Jesus as The Divine Worker, several public contests among artists and students of Fine Art Academies, as well as prizes-purchases established in national scale events—for works with Christ as a subject—have consistently expanded the number of works that are now part of the collection. Many outstanding works by painters such as De Chirico, Dottori, Carrà, Rosai, Tozzi, Menzio, Sassu, Fabbri, Pirandello and Greco, as well as the American artist William Congdon, to whom an entire section is dedicated, are part of it.&#13;

Born from the passion of the Fortini family for collecting ancient objects—crafts of every kind—the Mostra permanente degli antichi mestieri e della civiltà contadina exhibition features more than three thousand pieces related to the local rural environment. The Museum gathers together objects and tools that are regrouped into thematic sections by typology and destination of use, and that reconstruct aspects of the rural and artisanal world. Through this collection of objects it is possible to revisit the blacksmith, the carpenter, the shoemaker, the cooper and the lumberjack; it is possible to find the re-assembling of the characteristic items of a peasant’s cellar and his kitchen full of furnishing and fittings. There are sections dedicated to weights and measures, to the stables, the work in the fields and loom weaving.&#13;
The visitor is captured by the authenticity of the reconstruction of an old school room of the early years of the 1900s, with its schoolbags, books, old school desks, inkwells, pens, school reports, toys and so on.&#13;
The Permanent Exhibition of the Ancient Craft and Peasant Rural Life proposes Guided Visits all year long, and they are for school students of every level and grade. Some reviving representations of art and craft activities are foreseen upon request and weather permitting—activities nowadays disappeared—such as threshing by hand, spinning, winnowing the chaff and other activities once practiced in the countryside."

The Museo della Porziuncola is located in the Municipality of Assisi, it is part of the itinerary to visit the Santuario di Santa Maria degli Angeli, one of the most important places connected to the human and spiritual life of St Francis.&#13;
The museum is an integral part of the itinerary to visit the Sanctuary of Santa Maria degli Angeli; it takes the space of a few rooms inside the adjacent Convent of San Bernardino. Already established in 1924, it was set up again, on the occasion of the 2000 Jubilee, following a thematic and chronological organization of the exhibit. The itinerary is introduced by a scale model, reproducing the territory surrounding the Porziuncola before the Franciscan friars established their settlement, and follows themes such as the Porziuncola between the 13th and the 16th century, the Marian iconography and that of the Basilica realized by the architect Galeazzo Alessi.&#13;
Room A, the intent of the exhibit here is to show the history of the Porziuncola—in Latin Portiuncula—as a “small pre-Franciscan church” and its landscape view; inside this room, a marble plaque—sculpted in relief and with two crosses inscribed in an architectural frame remounting to the 9th or 10th century that once probably covered the ancient altar—is displayed. In Room B there is the Crucifix depicting The Christus Patiens of Giunta da Pisano and the altarpiece of the Master of Saint Francis of the same century: according to tradition the body of the saint was laid down on it, when it was translated from the Portiuncula to Assisi to receive a solemn burial ceremony. The wooden pulpit known to be of St Bernadine, which can be dated to the early years of the 15th century, and the Altarpiece in sculpted and glazed clay depicting the Coronation of the Virgin of Andrea della Robbia, executed around 1475, are located in Room C. Inside Room D, which is dedicated to the Marian iconography, the Madonna del Latte is hosted, a sculpture from the end of the 14th century. Originally the statue was positioned inside a tabernacle above the Portiuncula façade. Inside Room E, the last one, it is possible to see the description, through graphic evidence, of the building stages of Galeazzo Alessi Basilica. Furthermore, in this Room there are also paintings from the 17th century, depicting the most important saints of the religious Order executed by artists such as Francesco Providoni and Cesare Sermei."

The Museo di San Pietro and the Cripta di San Vittorino are located in Assisi, in the Benedictine Abbey Complex of San Pietro, in the interior of the 14th century surrounding wall of the historical center. The homonymous city entrance gate is nearby. From the green terraced square it is possible to admire a suggestive panorama over the Umbrian Valley. &#13;
The Church of San Pietro represents another example of Umbrian Romanesque Architecture.&#13;
The Museum has been located in the locals of the ancient cellars of the Abbazia Benedettina di San Pietro since 2002. Founded in the 10th century in a suburban area, it has been included inside the urban walls since the 14th century. Of pertinence to the exhibition and included in the visit itinerary are also: the Cripta di San Vittorino, Bishop of Assisi in the 3rd century A.D.; the Sacello delle Reliquie, a chapel in which the relics of the saint are preserved; the sarcophagus; the remnants of the Porta Urbica, a city gate that is part of the ancient Roman urban wall; the Pozzo dei Martiri, a well where the companions of St Victorinus were martyred; and the 1200s underground passageway that departing from the Abbey leads to the Ospedale dei Poveri, the hospice built in 1250.&#13;
Among the works of art preserved in the Museum there is The Enthroned Madonna with Child and the SS Victorinus and Peter—a 1400s triptych executed by Matteo da Gualdo—and a collection inspired by the theme of St Francis and the Representation of the Christmas Crèche in Contemporary Art, that includes, among others, works of Dalì, Sassu, Balla, Funi e Fazzini."

The Museo Diocesano and the Cripta di San Rufino are in Piazza San Rufino, in the northwest sector of Assisi. This has been the area of the Superior Terrace, whose squared travertine marble blocks on the southern side of the wall are still visible inside the Cathedral and Crypt of San Rufino, since the 2nd century B.C. Along the wall, near the bell tower, there is a quadrangular water cistern. The Museum itinerary goes through the Crypt of San Rufino, through the medieval cloister and enters into the next building’s subterranean foundation passages, the Palazzo dei Canonici. In the area of the Cathedral, some traces of an ancient center of ceramic production, dating back from the 1st century B.C., have been found.&#13;
The Museum was rearranged in 2006. The collection, instituted in 1941 by the Bishop Giuseppe Placido Nicolini, includes works pertaining to the Cathedral or coming from the Confraternity Oratories of Assisi and suppressed parishes. They are subdivided into five sections: detached frescoes; paintings on wooden panels and on canvases; liturgical items; goldsmith items; and Ancient Roman and medieval gravestones. &#13;
Among the works recommended there are the frescoes of the Master of Santa Chiara and those of Pace di Bartolo and Puccio Capanna. The latter, coming from the Oratorio of San Rufinuccio, represents some episodes of The Passion of Christ. Dating back to 1334, they are inspired by the painting cycle in the Basilica di San Francesco, and particularly by the frescoes of Pietro Lorenzetti to whom Puccio Capanna looks for inspiration for the framework of his composition in The Flagellation. The professional banners are also very interesting, in particular the one coming from the Confraternita di Santa Caterina d’Alessandria, dated around 1625, depicting The Martyrdom of St Catherine of Alessandria and SS James and Anthony Abbot, which is largely attributed to the artist Orazio Riminaldi from Pisa. In the Museum, there is also preserved: a Polyptyc of Niccolò Liberatore, called the Alunno, and paintings of Matteo di Gualdo, Dono Doni and Cesare Sermei.&#13;
An important space in the Exhibition is taken by a donation, the Perkins Collection, a legacy from the American Art reviewer Federico Mason Perkins, who died in 1955 and was deeply bound to Assisi. Above all, this collection contains works that predominantly come from the Tuscan school between the 14th and 15th centuries. Among the featured artists there is: Jacopo della Quercia, Filippo Lippi, Francesco di Giorgio Martini and Duccio di Buoninsegna."

The Pinacoteca Comunale is located in the historical center of Assisi, at a short walking distance from the Basilica of San Francesco. It is housed in Palazzo Vallemani, the 17th century residence that was initially the property of the Giacobetti noble family and later of the Vallemani. The palace has hosted the Municipal Library, some Cultural Institutions and the Accademia Properziana del Subasio.&#13;
The collection was started at the end of the 19th century with the aim of preserving the town’s artistic heritage, in many cases placed outside and exposed to the weather. The visitor can therefore observe an “unusual” aspect of Assisi, tied to its religious, political and civil evolution. &#13;
Rearranged in 2007 inside Palazzo Vallemani, a 17th century palace, the Art Gallery collects paintings from the 13th to the 16th centuries, the majority of them coming from public buildings, various aedicule, public gates—town entrances—brotherhood residences and hospices. Among the finest works there is the Majesty—attributed to Giotto—coming from the Palazzo del Capitano del Popolo; a Gonfalon, a processional banner of Niccolò di Liberatore, called Alunno; and The Virgin with Child, which was detached from the gate of Porta San Giacomo—attributed to a young Perugino. There are also paintings of Ottaviano Nelli, Andrea and Tiberio d’Assisi, paintings on canvases of Dono Doni, Giacomo Giorgetti and Cesare Sermei. A large space is dedicated to the Masters, followers of Giotto: one room is dedicated to the works of Puccio Capanna, among them there is the fine Madonna with Child and St Francis coming from the gate Porta San Rufino. &#13;
A room on the ground floor of the Gallery is dedicated to Multimedia instruments documenting the history of Assisi through its urban evolution.&#13;
The Gallery also hosts a Memorial Exhibition: Museo della Memoria Assisi 1943-1944, to honor the action taken by the town of Assisi during World War II events –1943 and 1944—to save Jewish people, the display will last until 31st December. &#13;
The initiative is held by the will of the Opera Casa Papa Giovanni, under the guidance of Monsignor Sergio Goretti, in collaboration with the local municipality, the Comune di Assisi, the regional institutions of La Regione Umbria and the provincial La Provincia di Perugia, it is also under the patronage of the ISUC—Istituto per la Storia dell’Umbria Contemporanea—and the Italy-Israel Association (Perugian section) together with the Franciscan Pilgrimage Programs. The Exhibition, conceived by and under the care of Marina Rosati—and whose texts are under the care of Annabella Donà with the collaboration of the Historian Francesco Santucci—collects numerous unpublished documents, photos and texts related to the period of the Shoah. The purpose of the Exhibition is to recount the role played by the population of Assisi that—during the German occupation—gave their help to avoid the deportation of a substantial number of Jewish people. The Memorial Museum collects writings, unpublished documents and photos related to that historical period and above all to the protagonists, who were directly involved in saving approximately 300 Jewish people."

Along the external staircase, the Papal Coats of Arms and the frescoes of the Majesty and Saints and of SS Peter and Paul attest to the long period of subordination of the town to the Papal State. The collection, formed in 1904, mostly with works from State requisitions and local family legacies, includes material of various genres and strictly tied to local history.&#13;
Among the many works of art it is worth noting the St Anthony of Padua and the Compassionate Madonna with SS Stephen and Jerome and Clients of Pietro Vannucci, called Perugino, the St Michael Archangel of Fiorenzo di Lorenzo, The Adoration of the Shepherds of Dono Doni, the Madonna in Glory and Saints of Jacopo Siculo, the SS Peter and Paul of Giuseppe Ribera, called Spagnoletto, and the glazed terracotta statue of St Anthony of Padua, ascribable to the Della Robbia milieu.&#13;

The main room, 12 by 6,75 meters—whose walls were decorated with niches and marble slab coating—shows a rich mosaic of inlaid black and white cut stones reproducing a marine subject with octopuses, dolphins and lobsters at its center, which can be dated back to the 2nd century A.D."

&#13;
The Tempietto del Clitunno—in the shape of a small Temple of the kind the Romans called sacellum—is located in Pissignano, under Campello sul Clitunno Municipality, along the slope of Colle San Benedetto, which dominates the Spoleto Valley. Considered one of the most interesting early-medieval monuments of Umbria, it is one of the seven jewels of Longobard art and architecture in Italy, which were recently included in the prestigious UNESCO World Heritage list.&#13;
Among the most attractive elements of the visit to this place is its suggestive location, already described by Pliny the Younger as a place covered by “old cypress trees, a spring gushes out, which, breaking up into different and unequal streams, forms itself, after several windings, into a large, broad basin of water”. (C. Plinius Cecilius Secundus, Panegiricus VIII, 8) 1&#13;
The construction, which was built with re-used architectural elements of ancient Roman times, and probably with remnants of a pre-existing Sanctuary structure dedicated to a deity called Clitumnus (identified with Jupiter), has the form of a small Classical Temple: it stands on a high podium with a frontal Corinthian colonnade of four columns—pronao tetrastilo—supporting the entablature where there is an inscription dedicating the church to the “God of the Angels”.&#13;
Inside, where it is possible to enter mounting two ramps of stairs, there is the apse with a complex decoration where a relief sculpture—in origin polychrome—and frescos—with Christian themes depicting Jesus Christ Pantocrator, SS Peter and Paul and the Angels with the gem decorated cross—dated from the 8th century A.D. join together. The small aedicule-tabernacle circumscribed by the apse is made of re-used sculptured elements of the 1st century A.D.&#13;
Believed to have been a Roman sacellum for a long time, the Temple has been the subject of a number of interpretations concerning its phases of construction. A first dating theory sees it built as a church, between the 4th and 5th century A.D., dedicated to San Salvatore. Recent studies, instead, have enabled scholars to ascribe the chronology of the building to the Longobard age, with a margin of oscillation going between the early 7th and well into the 8th century.&#13;

&#13;
The Antiquarium is set in a 14th century palace, Palazzetto del Podestà of Collemancio, a small village on a hill in the Municipality of Cannara.&#13;
Set up in 2003, in the 14th century Palazzetto del Podestà, the Antiquarium hosts materials coming from investigations in the territory and excavations still in course in the ancient Urvinum Hortense, an ancient Roman town located in the north-eastern proximity of the medieval village of Collemancio, up on the summit, in the flat called Pianoro della Pieve. The area has been the object of systematic campaigns of excavation led by the Università degli Studi di Perugia since 1998, which have brought to light an ancient settlement surrounded by a wall, visible in part in the western sector of the flat. Its floor plan is structured to follow the axis of the ancient Roman road connecting Urvinum Hortense with Mevania—now Bevagna—and Vettona—now Bettona—along which a Temple dated from the 2nd century B.C. once stood.&#13;
The small, but significant, selection of items collected in the Antiquarium illustrates all the settlement phases that emerged from the excavations and the archaeological finds from the surface. On display there are: the 6th 5th century B.C. Bronzetto di devoto—a votive bronze statue typical in Umbrian sanctuaries—attesting the existence of a pre-Roman cult on the site; and a group of architectural terracotta, which covered the wall of the Temple’s façade—found in the excavation site—testifying to the building of monuments on cult sites, with the spreading of the Roman culture in the region. Among these, the Potnia theròn—the ‘Lady of the animals’ in Homer’s Iliad, definition used to refer to the hunting goddess Artemis—stands out. Other materials, such as ceramics, epigraphs and architectural elements, complete the collection. &#13;
The Palazzetto del Podestà of Collemancio is also the seat of the Fondazione Urvinum Hortense, a foundation that has promoted initiatives of enhancement, including the excavation work of the antiquities in the Urbinate area, since 1986."

The Museo della Città e del Territorio has its premises on three floors of a building—expressly restored to host it—in Piazza IV Novembre, a square in the southern sector of the town of Cannara.&#13;
The museum is dedicated to the history of the town of Cannara and its territory—the geographical area under its administration—and offers the opportunity to deepen the knowledge of its history from its origins up to the modern age. A visit to this museum is enriched by the numerous historical residences and churches of the city and by the archaeological excavations and the Antiquarium of Hurvinum Orthense located in the nearby locality of Collemancio.&#13;
Of recent realization—2008—this exhibition mainly documents the continuity of life on the Pieve di Collemancio flat, which was the site of the important ancient Roman settlement—that sprang up around the 2nd century B.C.—of Hurvinum Ortense, up to its abandonment between the 6th and 9th centuries and the construction of the church of the Pieve di Santa Maria de Orbinum (that in Latin means Urbino).

The Chiesa-Museo di Sant’Antonio Abate is located in the center of Cascia, just outside the town walls, right after the Porta Orientale entrance.&#13;
Once, the Church of Sant’Antonio was part of the Benedictine complex of ancient origins, re-built around the end of the 14th century. Moreover, after the ruinous earthquake in 1703, the church underwent a radical change, an intervention that altered its structure, but fortunately spared both the apse and the nun’s choir at its back. Today the deconsecrated church has been transformed into a museum.&#13;
The presbytery and the choir of the nuns, unchanged over time, notwithstanding numerous hands of painting, preserve two interesting cycles of frescoes. The first, the one in the presbytery, depicts Episodes of the life of St Anthony Abbott, to whom the church is dedicated, and is the work of an anonymous painter, the Master of the Dormitio of Terni, a very interesting Umbrian artist active between the end of the 14th and the beginning of the 15th century. The second, the one with the Stories of the Passion of Christ, was executed in 1461 by Nicola da Siena and is one of the works that testifies most clearly to the author’s late Gothic narrative taste.&#13;
The Cascia Museum Circuit was inaugurated in 1997, and is organized in two main sites: Palazzo Santi and the Church of Sant’Antonio Abate. The latter was the property of the Benedictine friars and was part of an ancient complex.&#13;
The monumental wooden sculpture group of Tobiolo and the Angel executed in the second half of the 15th century is inside the church. For its undisputable preciousness, the group has become the symbol of the entire museum circuit. Originally, the work was inside the town Church of Sant’Agostino, where it decorated the altar dedicated to the Archangel Raphael. &#13;
Recent studies have attributed the work to Domenico Indivini, already known as the engraver of the choir of the Basilica Superiore di San Francesco in Assisi.&#13;
Apart from the group of Tobiolo and the Angel, the Baroque altars, which decorate the walls of the church, are also interesting. They were added during the radical intervention made in the 17th century. On the main altar there is a gilded and carved wooden tabernacle in the shape of a small Three Order Temple. &#13;
Behind the façade, a precious organ—from the 17th century—is placed."

Palazzo Santi stands in the historical center of Cascia, in the higher part of the main square dedicated to the Italian politician Aldo Moro.&#13;
This palace that once was the city residence of the wealthy family of the Santi—who reached the height of their economical success and political prestige at the beginning of the 17th century—hosts the Museo Comunale. It was Pierluigi Santi, the most influential member of this family, who ordered the restoration work and the partial re-building of the building between 1600 and 1601, which had been severely damaged by the earthquake of 1599.&#13;
The visit to the Museo Comunale di Palazzo Santi is part of Cascia’s Museum Circuit, together with the nearby Chiesa-Museo di Sant’Antonio Abate. The Museum was inaugurated in 1997, and exhibits materials mainly coming from the surrounding territory. On the Ground Floor—where there is the Ticket Office that is also a Bookshop furnished with furniture and fittings of an old Pharmacy of the town—a hall introduces two rooms used for the archaeological collection, and in one of them it is possible to observe the funerary items collected in the Hellenistic tomb—3rd-2nd centuries B.C.—found in the nearby locality of Maltignano. On the Main Floor, the most valuable works of the collection are displayed, following a typological criterion. In particular, the collection of sculptures, which includes wooden works, works in terracotta, plaster and stone—dating between the 13th and 15th centuries—stands out for its fine quality. Among them it is worth mentioning the Madonna from Poggioprimocaso—also called The Pink Madonna—that is a monumental example of the flourishing production of wooden sculptures of polychrome Madonnas, which the territory is rich with.&#13;
A section of the Museum is dedicated to paintings, works of Lazzaro Baldi and Domenico Corvi. A small room is dedicated to Cardinal Fausto Poli, the powerful secretary of Pope Urban VIII, who was born in this area.&#13;
The collection can also boast a Vesperbild plasterwork of the 15th century. The Vesperbild is an iconographical representation of the Pieta—associated with the Mendicant Orders and mystical milieu—of Franco-German origins in the Rhine area. The numerous samples of the kind are still preserved today in Umbria, from Spoleto to Visso and from Preci to Narni. They make you think of the existence of specialized workshops in the territory."

The palace, as it stands now, is the result of regularizations of the previous properties of the Baglioni family, expanded and completed by Ascanio’s successors. The fresco cycle adorning its walls is among the highest&#13;
examples of noble decorations in Umbria. Its focus is on exalting Ascanio’s heroic deeds, also recurring to mythological themes and fortunes associated with the Lake Trasimeno territory. Its execution was commissioned to Ascanio’s nephew, Niccolò Circignani, called Pomarancio, from Diomede Della Penna Della Corgna in 1574. Among his co-workers Giovanni Antonio Pandolfi, whose hand is recognizable in some scenes in the Aeneid Room, emerges from the collaborators. The Medieval Fortress—once a Perugian garrison to control over the territories around Lake Trasimeno—is connected to Della Corgna Palace through a passageway commissioned by Della Cornia to facilitate an escape route in case of attacks."

Housed inside the 16th century former Church of SS Gesù e Maria, the Museum is arranged in three main sections: a multipurpose room on the ground level, two rooms in the crypt dedicated to the anthropological finds and a laboratory for study and research located on the lower level of the edifice.&#13;
There are 23 mummies of men, women and children, with different degrees of preservation that go from complete mummification, in eight bodies, to partial mummification, in other seven, up to the total skeletonization in the remaining eight bodies.&#13;
The analysis of the bodies found, together with the paleopathological investigation, has also allowed for the diagnosing of some diseases that hit the local population between the 18th - mid 19th centuries.&#13;
Of extreme interest, for reconstructing the history of cranial surgery in Umbria during the Renaissance period, is the presence of a young-male-adult skull, of an individual about 20-25 years old, which shows evident signs of drilling and a long period of survival."

The Church of Santa Maria dei Bianchi, which was already the Oratory of the Disciplined, preserves one of the best works among Perugino’s masterpieces, the fresco depicting “The Adoration of the Magi”.&#13;
In 1504 the Disciplined Confraternity—or Santa Maria dei Bianchi—of Città della Pieve, native town of Pietro Vannucci, called Perugino, starts negotiating the commission to fresco the wall behind the altar of its oratory with the artist. From Perugia, where the artist resided, he answered that the request could be satisfied in return for a payment of 200 florins, but as “fellow countryman” he was willing to accept the commission for the sum of 100. It seems that the confraternity declared to not have even this sum, so&#13;
Perugino, declaring in another letter that he would lower the amount to 25 florins, asked them to come to take him with a mule right away, because he was ready to execute the work.&#13;

subdivided—and chronologically ordered by the artist himself—into four sections: paintings, sculptures, graphics and scenography.&#13;
The exhibition covers two floors of the building, and entirely retraces Burri's artistic experience; from the outset up until the most complex and abstract works, where the often torn-off and “suffering-matter”, becomes a work of art in itself.&#13;
The attention of the artist towards the transformation of matter—both natural or induced—directly exercised on materials such as tar, sacking, woods, iron and plastics by the artist himself, recalls his scientific&#13;
background-in fact Burri graduated in Medical Science in 1940.&#13;
The theatrical scenographic sketches are also of great interest; in fact, the artist signed scenes and costumes for an edition of Wagner's Tristan and Iseult, staged at the Teatro Regio of Turin, La Fenice of Venice and the Opera of Rome in 1975.&#13;

The exhibition is held in nine of the palace rooms, where the history of the textile company, ""Tela Umbra"", which the baroness Alice Hallgarten and the Baron Leopoldo Franchetti founded in 1908, is reconstructed.&#13;
Along the display, a particular relevance is given to the figure of the Baroness. She was a close friend of the well-known educator and reformer Maria Montessori. Thanks to her, a small school was created inside the&#13;
workshop, where—while the mothers worked—the children could study following the Montessori method.&#13;
Old school desks and didactic instruments recreate the environment in which Alice Hallgarten’s intense social involvement and Montessori's method found an extraordinary fusion.&#13;
As the tutelage and promotion of textile art in the social-cultural reality of the territory is the mission of this museum, it displays textile creations, yarns, old handlooms, laces and instruments of various use and samples of all textile fabric produced by the workshop. The museum itinerary includes a visit to the&#13;
Collection of Textiles and to the Workshop, in which all the manufacturing phases are still manually processed today.&#13;
Apart from the Tela Umbra Workshop, the New Yorker Alice Hallgarten was known for having founded Villa&#13;
Montesca and Rovigliano Schools in 1901. Both institutions were open for free for peasants’ children up until the sixth grade. Their aim was to provide the required training for peasants through practical and useful lessons in daily life."

&#13;
Located in Piazza Gabriotti, the Museo del Duomo of Città di Castello stands next to the Cathedral dedicated to the Saints Floridus and Amantio, and with its surface of 800 square meters it is one of the largest Italian museums dedicated to sacred art.&#13;
Originally the museum consisted of only two rooms, to which access was provided by the cathedral sacristy. Institutionalized in 1991, it has seen its expositive space extended with the opening of 5 other rooms on two&#13;
floors, obtained from the reuse of space taken from 17 and 18 century sacristies and from rooms in 14 and 15 century edifices that had already belonged to the church.&#13;
In 2000 the last architectonic intervention extended the exhibition space to 12 rooms, including a large Gothic hall with transversal pointed arches, maybe originally part of a religious edifice, it has undergone a laborious work of restoration like the other spaces. The collection, which was formed with the aim of providing an adequate space for the works of art, property&#13;
of the Cathedral Chapter and of the churches of the area, is distinguished for the quantity and quality of liturgical items dating from the 6 to the 19 century. Apart from the Canoscio Treasure, evidence of the cults practiced by the 6 century local Christian communities, the collection preserves goldsmith work,&#13;
among which there is a 12 century Altarpiece and a Crosier top of Sienese manufacture, Chalices, Patens, Monstrances and liturgical Vestments showing the impeccable status of the majority of the liturgical goods ensemble.&#13;
The Museum is also responsible for the conservation of important documentary evidence of the ecclesiastical history of the town. Among them is the Parchment of Frederick I, The Holy Roman Emperor,&#13;
also called Barbarossa, literally red beard—with which he took the clergy under his protection—not counting paintings of illustrious artists from outside the area, such as Pinturicchio and Rosso Fiorentino, or local ones&#13;
like Francesco da Tiferno and Bernardino Gagliardi."

The Oratorio di San Crescentino is located in Morra, a locality a few kilometers from Città di Castello. Built in 1420 and enlarged in 1507, the Oratory was dedicated to the Roman soldier Crescentinus, a witness of the Christian faith in the High Tiber Valley and martyrized in 303 A.D. by order of the Emperor Diocletian.&#13;
The inside of the Oratory has a single nave that preserves late Gothic frescoes related to the original structure in the sacristy and, along the walls, a decoration executed by the workshop of the painter from&#13;
Cortona, Luca Signorelli (1450-1523). The scenes of the Flagellation and the Crucifixion are the only ones made by the hands of this artist."

&#13;
Palazzo Vitelli, seat of the Pinacoteca Comunale—the Civic Gallery—that reopened to the public in 1995, is located in the city center of Città di Castello, very close to the urban walls in Via della Cannoniera.&#13;
The sober Renaissance architectural style of the palace is enriched by elegant monochromatic frescoes of Cristoforo Gherardi on the façade towards the garden—probably done with the designs of Giorgio Vasari—&#13;
and by a portico towered over by a Loggia, in which there is a collection of sculptures, among them a number of terracotta by Andrea della Robbia.&#13;
Part of the decorations of the internal halls and rooms pertain to Gherardi but Cola dell’Amatrice also participated in it.&#13;
Subdivided into 26 rooms, to which further exhibit space is added for temporary displays, the Civic Gallerycollects works of art dating from the 14 to the 20 century, the majority of which were acquired as public&#13;
property as a consequence of the requisition after Italy’s reunification. These testify to the artistic vitality of the area, a crossroads of important means of communication and cultural exchanges between different areas, and to the artists held in high esteem and in large part from outside the area: Raphael, LucaSignorelli, Domenico Ghirlandaio, Andrea Della Robbia, Lorenzo Ghiberti, Antonio  Vivarini, Raffaellino del&#13;
Colle, Pomarancio and Santi di Tito. Three important donations find their places in the rooms inaugurated in 2006: the gipsothèque of Elmo Palazzi (1871-1915), sculptor from Città di Castello; a collection of bronze&#13;
executed by Bruno Bartoccini (1910-2001); and the Collection Ruggeri, which gathers together some twenty paintings of Italian artists from the 1900s.&#13;
In the rooms in the semi-basement, a large Malacologic collection can be visited for free.&#13;
The Gallery furniture was not part of the original furnishings of the palace, but instead was part of the Elia Volpi donation to the Municipality of Città di Castello in 1912, and as owner of the edifice, he was responsible for the latest restoration work of the palace as well. Tables of typical 15 century Umbrian workmanship or of conventual provenance and chairs and high chairs, dating around the 17 and 18 centuries, are examples. The pieces of higher value and historical interest are the furniture of churches and&#13;
monasteries of fortified estates. The group of carved Gothic stalls with decorated inlaying is interesting. It isattributed to the workshop of the most famous Florentine woodworker of the early 15 century, Manno di&#13;
Benincasa Mannucci. The choir and the sacristy cabinet, signed and dated 1501, together with the huge carved and gilded sarcophagus that contained the body of the Beata Margherita are all among the best&#13;
evidence documenting the high quality of Umbrian manufacture at the end of the 16 century."

The Museo del Modellismo Ferroviario is in the southern outskirts of the town of Città di Castello, hosted inside Villa Cappelletti.&#13;
The Villa, a recently restored 16 century noble residence, is mentioned in historical documents of the town as a property estate of Cardinal Vitelli, a powerful local prelate connected to the Florentine family of the&#13;
Medici.&#13;
Later on the Villa belonged to the Marquis Gioacchino Cappelletti—a descendant of Giulietta Capuleti—who had cultivated a strong passion for collecting scale modeling transportation machines since his youth. During&#13;
his long life, this led him to put together a rich collection of that kind, and to donate it along with the villa to Città di Castello’s Municipality.&#13;
This Museum, together with the Center for Folkloristic Heritage ""Livio Dalla Ragione"" is part of the Garavelle Museum Complex. The exhibition is currently held on the first floor of Villa Cappelletti, in the spacious halls,&#13;
living rooms, parlors and rooms that used to be part of the residence of the Cappelletti family.&#13;
The Collection, donated along with the Villa to the Cassa di Risparmio Foundation of Città di Castello in 1963, consists of more than 150 models of Train engines on a 1:20 and 1:40 scale. The eleven—still&#13;
working—steam engine locomotives, the seventeen passenger coaches, the eighty-eight freight wagons together with the models of agricultural steam-machinery, models of road maintenance machines, and a&#13;
diorama of an Old Train Station makes this collection one of the most important of its kind in Italy and probably in all of Europe."

The Antiquarium is located in a beautiful position, at the far end of the western part of the town, outside the 15 century mighty walls of Corciano. Opened in 2009, the museum is subdivided into three sections:&#13;
Paleontological, Prehistoric and Proto-historical and Archaeological.&#13;
All these sections present finds that had already been collected and held, in a small quantity, inside the rooms of the Town Hall since the 1990s.&#13;
In the Paleontological section, it is possible to admire the fossil remnants of the Mesozoic Ammonites from Migiana—Lower Early Jurassic—and that of the Quaternary Mammals—Lower Pleistocene—from Ellera; an&#13;
updated didactic apparatus illustrates two of the important and far away stages in the history of the Corciano area.&#13;
The Prehistoric and Proto-historical sections, mainly consisting of stone tools collected in several localities of the region, offer an interesting panoramic picture of Umbria, from the Upper Paleolithic to the Iron Age. Two&#13;
cinerary vases, dated from the latter period, testify the diffusion of the Villanovan Culture in the territory between Trasimeno Lake and Perugia.&#13;
The section dedicated to Classical Archaeology opens with the reconstruction of two princely chariots, found on April 1912 near Castel San Mariano inside a tomb dating from the 6 century B.C.&#13;
Then comes the section dedicated to Sanctuaries, simple enclosures or altars built along the main roads of communication and on top of the hills, dedicated to deities, protectors of health, the body, fertility, affluence and livestock breeding.&#13;
The Hellenistic period is represented by materials coming from the Etruscan Necropolises of Strozzacapponi and Fosso Rigo, with the reconstruction of three burial sites that have their funerary goods placed in the&#13;
original position. The section ends with an interesting nucleus of items from the Roman period, represented by the finds coming from the Roman Villa of Palazzo Grande and the funerary goods from the so called&#13;
“tombs a cappuccina"", discovered in the area."

The Museo della Casa Contadina is located in the historical city center of Corciano.&#13;
It was born in 1976 thanks to the passion of some local people and the Pro-Loco, to which the initiative of researching and collecting items of everyday life in the popular domestic economy and of craftsmanship is due.&#13;
Further donations, have enriched the collection over time, avoiding the dispersion of a heritage that testifies the rural past of Corciano, today assaulted—as a number of other towns in the region—by an imposing industrial development. &#13;
Although, taking inspiration from the life conditions of a family living inside the civics walls, the Museum documents the wider rural context where the work of the peasants and the economy of survival connected to it was done and lived.&#13;
In fact the rooms, in which the domestic utensils of common use and the tools used in agricultural activities are collected, revive the traditional rural home: the stables, the granary, the kitchen and the bedroom.&#13;
Inside the ""fondo"", a storage room, which is connected to the stables, together with the items usually furnishing a typical rural cellar, the barrel, the ""bigoncio""—a wooden tub—and the flasks, there is the most relevant hand made piece of Corciano's collection, a wooden framed handloom, complete with all the accessories needed for hand weaving and hand spinning, such as spindles, some “naspo”—to wind up yarns—distaffs and bobbins.&#13;
In the kitchen, dominated by the huge fireplace—around which the most important domestic activities were carried out—and fulcrum of the social life of the house—there is displayed a spout, the “acina” to wash clothes and the wooden rustic cupboard used for kneading bread or pasta dough. The bedroom is furnished with an iron bed with its traditional cushion full of cornhusks that served as a mattress. In addition, there is a bed warmer called ""prete"", a baby walker called ""girello"", a lavabo stand and embroidered linen and towels.&#13;
A series of old pictures and sacred images contribute to the reconstruction of the atmosphere of the peasants' 19th century rural social religious environment in Corciano."

The Museo Diocesano Diffuso of Pieve del Vescovo stands facing—while immersed in a green valley below—the historical city center of Corciano.&#13;
It is considered to be one of the most significant architectural monuments in Perugian territory. The castle was built at the end of the 14 century, around and above a pre-existing religious edifice.&#13;
During the Renaissance, however, the majestic bastion lost its rigidly conceived defensive characteristics, acquiring the prerogatives of a noble opulent residence, embellished by a splendid garden. Enriched with&#13;
comforts and precious decorations, the complex became the assiduous destination of Perugian bishops for their long stays.&#13;
Currently the castle, with its squared floor plan and its four perimetric towers, still stands as a massive and imposing mansion. And while its complex architectural stratification is of great interest, allowing an attentive&#13;
eye to detect the various phases of its construction, the rich decorative heritage left inside, both pictorial and plastic, is no less significant."

The internal space was furnished with platforms on three sides where the urns, containing the ashes of the deceased and their funerary goods, were placed.&#13;
A large number of lower social ranking personalities, free men or freed slaves are sided next to the traditional noble high ranks. The Strozzacapponi agglomerate structure constitutes a perfect example of organized necropolises, following a precise plan. The burial rite is incineration, ordinarily used in the Perugian territory during the Hellenistic period. The deceased body was burnt and its ashes were collected inside urns made of travertine marble or kept inside ""olles""—ceramic—vases.&#13;
The urns, whose samples are exhibited at the Municipal Antiquarium in Corciano, generally have a levigated surface and, only in some cases, are sculpted or enriched with lively polychrome decorations. The name of&#13;
the deceased is often sculpted on the covers.&#13;
The necropolis was attended between the 3 and the 1 century B.C., and was associated with the settlement connected with the extraction activity in the quarries of travertine marble in Santa Sabina locality.&#13;
The transformation of the necropolis into a museum is intended as part of a broader plan for the realization of a naturalistic-archaeological itinerary, which also includes the Fosso Rigo Necropolis, used by the craftsmen working on the local stone."

The Oil Mill, dating from the 17 -18 century, was active until very recent times, when it was the property of Mr. Carlo Bartoletti. It is the largest and oldest oil mill in the area and is an important evidence of the olive culture, largely already widespread in Montefeltro Duchy in the 15 century.&#13;
The mill has been called ""Il Montano"" since the beginning. The term probably comes, after a series of linguistic transformations, from ""molendium"", which means “mill” in the Latin language.&#13;
The structure consists of a large millstone for grinding the olive into a paste, and of a powerful Oakwood beam anchored to another stone as a counterweight. On the large beam it is possible to see the notch to&#13;
count the amount of olives processed, and the oil produced from the olive pressing process, and in a drawer it is possible to find the old bloc notes in which the income and the expenses of the mill were noted."

mountains before seeing the light of day, at springs feeding the water stratum of the flats below.&#13;
To simplify the explanations and make the described phenomena immediately visible, a large use of illustrating panels, films and multimedia posts is made available with a computerized system. This allows the visitor to have a synthetic picture of the main naturalistic land risings of the Park and its caves.&#13;
The museum visit starts with the representation of a cross section of Monte Cucco Caves, inside of which the rainwater runs through the calcareous rock to get down, almost 1000 meters lower, to the Scirca springs.&#13;

The large family collection, put together by the current owner to contrast the dispersion of samples in the antique market and in various European museums, illustrates the original pieces and the copies executed by the artists who participated in the factory activities. A nucleus of medieval painted ceramic fragments, which were found near the factory, opens the itinerary. A section is dedicated to the masters Alpinolo Magnini and Ubaldo Grazia, who in the course of the 1920s reproduced ostentatious pieces, plates made with the “lustro” technique—a procedure largely used by the majolica&#13;
makers from Deruta in the 16th century—rendering the glaze iridescent with gold reflexes by adding metallicsalts and a third firing in a kiln without oxygen."

The exhibition space covers a total surface area of 1700 square meters, subdivided into 1200 for the display and 500 for the deposits. Temporary exhibitions are periodically organized on the ground floor, and there is a Library specialized in the History of Ceramics, which contains more than 1400 volumes.&#13;
The Museum display itinerary is arranged in 14 rooms on three levels and in a large roomy space, which contains the ceramic materials and is also equipped for study activities. Apart from the archaeological section, offering an exemplary overview of the main products of ancient times in Italy and Greece, the Museum systematically documents local production from the Middle Ages up to the 1900s. Of a certain interest is the section dedicated to the luster colored Majolica, whose technique made the workshops of Deruta particularly famous in the 16th century. This is also true for the 17th century “comprehensive” production, characterized by a decorative and chromatic complexity. The thematic sections are dedicated to the ceramics utilized in pharmacy, reunited in an original Apothecary Shop furnishing set. The 16th century Majolica floor tiles and votive plates were often inspired by the ones in the nearby Madonna dei Bagni Sanctuary.&#13;

Formed early on in the 20th century, with works that were once property of churches that have become State owned, the collection has grown day by day in the course of the years. But this happened especially during the year of 1931, when Consilia Pascoli, heiress of the 17th century art collector and writer Lione Pascoli, donated something like forty works of art to the Municipality. &#13;
Among the works displayed, which the Pinacoteca comunale preserves on the First Floor, are the paintings from the Church of San Francesco and its surroundings: the Madonna of the Consuls, the Gonfalon of St Anthony Abbott of Niccolò di Liberatore—called l’Alunno—and the God The Father and SS Romano and Rocco of Pietro Vannucci—called Il Perugino—stand out.&#13;
On the Second Floor, the Pascoli Collection has been displayed: the donated works are about forty and were executed by artists—active between the 17th and the 18th centuries—such as Giovan Battista Gaulli, Sebastiano Conca, Francesco Trevisani, Antonio Amorosi, Francesco Graziani and Pietr Van Blomen, and are highly representative of early 18th century Roman art collecting."

&#13;
The Santuario della Madonna dei Bagni owes its name to the hill on which it stands, Colle del Bagno, not far from Deruta, where it was built in 1687 on the site of a miraculous event.&#13;
Tradition has it that a majolica fragment reproducing the image of the Virgin and Child was found here. Left on the trunk of a tree, the image became a cult object and was venerated. Then after a first miracle, it became a pilgrimage destination site for a number of sick people asking for solace, who left their own Exvoto on the Oak tree trunk. With the construction of the Sanctuary, which included the Oak tree together with the miraculous image, the ceramists in Deruta started the production of the Ex-voto for the use of faithful believers.&#13;
In the arch of time of three centuries more than 700 Ex-voto tiles constituting significant evidence&#13;
documenting the local religiosity and costumes have been collected here, along with knowledge of the technical and stylistic evolution of the majolica from Deruta."

&#13;
The Centro Italiano Arte Contemporanea (CIAC) was born from the initiative of the Cassa di Risparmio di Foligno Foundation. This Center represents the arrival point of a widespread and growing attention of the town of Foligno for contemporary artistic research, which saw its inception in the 1960s with important exhibitions, conventions, frequent contact with the protagonists of Italian and international art and an authoritative collecting. This is the historical premise the Center has embraced, focusing on the widespread cultural demand coming from the town, proposing itself as an agent to preserve and develop it, and conferring a concrete and dynamic reality to it.&#13;
The Museum was built in the historical center, where first the Milk factory and then the Post Office used to be. The Museum architecture was inspired by Alviani in collaboration with the architect Zamatti, and later realized by the architect Partenzi. &#13;
The architectural complex consists of a parallelepiped coated with Corten-Steel, which confers its typically rusty color to the external structure. Without windows, it extends over three floors and light enters from the central skylight, which is held by the pilasters that define, internally, the spaces. The schema is characterized by its simplicity and rigor. Light and Space are the protagonists, the building is located between the medieval apse of the Church of San Francesco and the “Liberty”—Art Nouveau—constructions of Via del Campanile, producing a harmonic impact that unites the old and the modern with a stimulating contrast right inside the historical center of the town.&#13;
The Exhibition rooms are on two floors. The spaces on the ground Floor are dedicated to hosting displays, meeting points and cultural events, projections and conferences."

&#13;
The Museo Archeologico Colfiorito (MAC) is in Colfiorito, a small mountain locality under the Municipality of Foligno, situated along an important ancient route junction connecting Umbria and the Sabin area with the Adriatic Sea.&#13;
The visit to the museum represents an occasion to know the dynamics of cultural development in this part of Umbria, in the Apennines, where humans have lived since prehistory, an area that has been steadily settled in by the Plestini—Umbrian people—since the archaic age. The museum itinerary is completed with the visit to the Parco Naturalistico di Colfiorito and to the museum dedicated to it—The Naturalistic Museum of Colfiorito Park—located in the vicinity.&#13;
The Archaeological Museum exhibits mainly finds from the excavations done in the area of Colfiorito and its plateau that have been collected since the 1960s. It is dedicated to the Plestini, a population of Umbrian origins that has been documented, especially here, in its most mature period of development, 7th– 5th century B.C. The display is organized in thematic sections where, in addition to the illustrative panels and multimedia stations, there are also reconstructions of the context in which the items and finds were found.&#13;
On the Ground Floor of the museum there is the Lapidarium, and its collection consists of stone slab fragments and finds coming from the area of the Roman town of Plestia and the Plestine territory: tubs, cornices and columns, but also inscriptions. The First Floor is entirely dedicated to the Pre-Roman Necropolis of Colfiorito—attended from the 9th to the 3rd century B.C.—together with the display of funerary items and of two re-built tombs in real size. On the Second Floor, the inhabitants of the urban settlements and the sanctuaries are illustrated, in particular the Castelliere of Mount Orve—a typical prehistoric fortified borough of the Bronze and Iron Age—and the Sanctuary dedicated to the Goddess Cupra, from which there are four bronze sheets with inscriptions indicating this goddess as the “mother of the Plestini”. The exhibition itinerary ends with the section dedicated to the urban organization of Plestia and the rustic settlements in the area of the Plateau."

The Museo Capitolare Diocesano is located in Piazza della Repubblica, ancient Platea Magna, which is the beating heart of the city of Foligno. Annexed to the Duomo di San Feliciano, documented since the 11th century, the museum is inserted into the space between the transept and the left aisle of the Duomo and the Palazzo delle Canoniche, which was radically transformed in 1746. With the 1923-26-restoration work, the palace was brought back to its sober origins, with the reopening of its double lancet windows and the adding of the crenellated battlement.&#13;
Fitted out since 2008 on the second floor of the Palazzo delle Canoniche, the museum now preserves approximately fifty works of art coming from the Cathedral and the area of the Diocese. The visit to the museum also includes a visit to the Cripta di San Feliciano, 7th-9th centuries, recently restored. &#13;
The museum exhibition, introduced by a wooden statue of the patron St Felician, displays works donated to the Cathedral in 1703 that were once property of a local family, the Roscioli. Two portrait busts made by the Workshop of Gian Lorenzo Bernini and a copy of the work of Raphael The Madonna of Foligno belong to this lot. Among the works coming from the Duomo there are the paintings of Ferraù Faenzoni and Pomarancio; while some medieval wooden sculptures, the paintings executed by Bartolomeo di Tommaso, the Tabernacle with the wooden Crucifix by Niccolò Alunno and Pietro Mazzaforte and the Workshop of San Giuseppe—attributed to Georges de La Tour—come from the churches of the town and the surrounding territory. To complete the collection there are silver and gilded copper processional crosses, 14th-16th centuries, liturgical items and numerous reliquaries already held in the crypt of the Cathedral."

The Museo di Palazzo Trinci is the town museum. Housed in Trinci Palace, it overlooks the old and former Piazza Grande, now Piazza della Repubblica that is the main square of Foligno.&#13;
Palazzo Trinci was built between the 14th and 15th centuries as the residence of the noble Trinci family, who governed the town during the period spanning from 1305 to 1439. As a consequence of the annexing of Foligno to the Papal State, this palace became the seat of the papal legates up until the unification of the nation—the historical period referred to as the Unità d’Italia in 1860—and was later destined to host the offices of the Prefect, the Prefettura, then the Demanio—the Italian State Property Authority—the Monopoly of the State and the Guardia di Finanza—a body of police forces dedicated to financial crime. The building, damaged after a number of modifications on its structure during the centuries—including the damage from an earthquake in 1831-32 and also the World War II bombing of Foligno—was closed in 1985 and restored. In 1997, the palace was reopened to the public, and has been the Museum of the town since 2000. It hosts the new display of the Art Gallery and two sections of the Archaeological Museum.&#13;
The noble palace of the Trinci deserves an attentive visit, both for the elegance of its external features and interior decorations and for the important art collections it hosts. In particular, the Art Gallery takes cares of the conservation of important works of artists who lived between the 14th and 16th century, such as Dono Doni, Bernardino di Mariotto, Giovanni di Corradinuccio, Pierantonio Mezzastris and Niccolò Alunno. Inside the building, it is above all worth noting the frescoed hall with the representation of The Liberal Arts and The Planets, which a recent discovery has attributed to the illustrious painter from the Marche region, Gentile da Fabriano, and the chapel decorated with Ottaviano Nelli frescoes depicting The Wedding of St Anna.&#13;
The Museum’s exhibition pathway, organized on three floors starting from the Gothic Stairs, hosts the Archaeological Museum, the Art Gallery, the Museum of the History of the Communal Institution and the Multimedia Museum of Tournaments and Jousts.&#13;
The Archaeological Museum has extensive documentation on the Umbrian autochthon populations of the Fulginates and the Plestini, as well as a collection of marbles, cinerary urns and sarcophaguses of Roman and Late Roman period. Other archaeological items, already part of the Trinci collection, are distributed around the frescoed rooms of the Museum, respecting the position in which they were originally placed. In the Art Gallery, whose origins date back to 1863, the works coming from the in town ecclesiastic buildings are collected, but above all there are the detached frescoes—removed with the intent of preserving them from destruction—which offer a more or less exhaustive cross-section of the local artistic production from the 14th to the 16th centuries.&#13;
The section dedicated to the History of the Communal Institution collects accounts testifying the history of the Commune from the 15th century to the unification—19th century—of the Unità d’Italia. Meanwhile, the Multimedia Museum of the Tournaments and Jousts, inaugurated in 2001, is the point of referral for the research and study of the history of the popular games of the town from the Middle Ages up to today."

The Museo Naturalistico del Parco di Colfiorito has its premises in the Ente Parco office, in the locality of “Casermette“ in Colfiorito, the small mountain village in the Municipality of Foligno.&#13;
Inaugurated in 2006 as a naturalistic museum, it is thought of as an exhibition and observation area for the Fauna and Flora species present in the Park. The museums itinerary is completed with the visit to the Archaeological Museum of Colfiorito (MAC) primarily dedicated to the settled population in the proto-history period in the Colfiorito Plateau. &#13;
The Museum is subdivided into seven sections: the first is the archaeological one, it goes back retracing the history of the territory from the Iron Age to the Medieval period; the other six are focused on Natural Sciences. The section dedicated to Paleontology displays a collection of fossils from Pleistocene, including a Hippo—Hippopotamus Antiquus—recovered in Colle Curti and dated 700.000 years ago. The section dedicated to Palynology—the study of fossils spores and pollens—illustrates the climatic and vegetative evolution of the place in the last 25.000 years through the study of lake sediments, which have evidenced the progressive drying of the Colfiorito Plateau. The next section is dedicated to Zoology, which observes native insects, in particular dragonflies and butterflies. Another section, the one with multimedia corners, enriches knowledge of the bird species living in the Park, in particular the rare and threatened ones, like the “Tarabuso”—Botaurus Stellaris, or commonly Bittern Heron—frequently seen in the marsh, which is renowned as a site of international interest for its climatic conditions of humidity. The exhibition itinerary is now enriched by a new section called “Antarctic”, created in line with a national program of research aimed at constituting an interregional observatory on this continent."

The Antiquarium is located in the central area of the medieval town of Fossato di Vico.&#13;
Its premises are located in the building that at first had been the Municipal building and that later hosted the local Theater.&#13;
The visit to the civic collection of Fossato di Vico represents an occasion to know the life of an area whose fortune and centrality resides in its favorable position, near a number of important busy roads that once crossed here. It was in fact located along the route of the ancient Consular Flaminia road, opened in 220 BC, of which important remains of the bridges, built to cross-rivers that have since disappeared, are still identifiable today. The displayed objects show that the small center had been vital from the prehistory up until Late Antiquity, and constantly mentioned in the Roman Itineraria, the Roman travel guides that contained the indications of the routes, distances and urban centers.&#13;
Inaugurated in 2001, it is located on the upper floor of the medieval building that used to be the Municipality and the local Theater. Articulated in two rooms, it is focused on documenting the history of the territory and the development of Fossato di Vico, the ancient Helvillum, built near the mountain passage of Fossato—740 meters above sea level—which was already functional for connecting the Apennines summer pasture places with the winter ones along the Adriatic sea. In the first room ancient geographical maps—views and maps from the 16th-19th centuries—and a small selection of items that goes from the ancient Roman ages to the modern era illustrate the territory. They are followed by chronologically ordered archeological findings and materials and architectural elements recovered from old excavation sites on the summit of the hill of the burgh related to a domus and a water container of the 1st century BC.&#13;
Concerning the various traces of ancient routes, which directly interested Fossato di Vico, it is suggested to visit the remains of the Roman bridges, near the locality of Palazzolo, to the south of the village, and to the north, at the foot of the burgh where the Bridge of San Giovanni is visible: both indicate the ancient Flaminia Way that in this area was slightly further to the west than the current State road."

&#13;
Rocca Flea stands on the top of the hill of San Michele Arcangelo, near the city center of Gualdo Tadino. Walking down Via della Rocca, after a short distance, through Porta San Benedetto, it is possible to get to the town main square.&#13;
It was born as the early-inhabited nucleus of the town of Gualdo Tadino, soon becoming one of the most important strongholds of Umbria.&#13;
During the 16th century it was transformed into the residence of the Papal Legates, and its interior was adapted for this purpose; its walls were decorated with frescoes, of which today only fragments remain. With its transformation into a prison, in 1888, further modifications were done to its structure. Recently, it has been restored, and today houses the Civic Museum.&#13;
Apart from the Museum, the Fortress is interesting to visit from an architectural point of view. In fact, the ancient stronghold that dominates the flat of Gualdo Tadino, like all ancient manors, has its rich heritage made of facts, characters and stories—often unknown to the public—that are contended between history and legend.&#13;
The exhibition itinerary of the Museo Civico di Rocca Flea is subdivided into three sections. The Archaeological section displays items documenting how Gualdo’s territory was populated from the prehistory to the Early Middle Ages. The section dedicated to ceramics illustrates the vast production around the 19th and 20th centuries, inspired by that of the 16th century that—being as good as that of Gubbio and Deruta—made Gualdo Tadino one of the most célèbre centers of production of ceramics in the region. The Art Gallery section, constituted after the State requisitions post-1860, and its collection includes works coming from the churches of the area and are fully representative of the figurative culture of the area on the border between Umbria and Marche. Of great interest is the majestic polyptych—coming from the Church of San Francesco—of Niccolò di Liberatore, called the Alunno (1471), and the 15th century paintings of Matteo da Gualdo—these too from San Francesco—the master who started the local art school that was active up until the first half of the 16th century. Matteo da Gualdo’s frescoes are still visible in the Church of San Francesco; visitors can see them on the occasions of initiatives organized by the Town Museums."

The Museo Regionale dell’Emigrazione Pietro Conti—Centro Ricerca sull’Emigrazione Italiana is a Museum and a Research Center, hosted in Palazzo Podestà, in the city center of Gualdo Tadino, a small town in the north-east area of Umbria near the border with the Marche region.&#13;
The Museum premises are inside the palace that once was the residence of the Podestà, the highest judicial and military magistrate in medieval Italian Communes. The 13th century Civic Tower is what remains today of this old manor, the Baroque lantern was added to it in later times.&#13;
The Museum was born to recover the memory of the migration experience and recounts—through voices, sounds, images, documents and objects—the fortunes of a population’s massive exodus “to far away lands” offering its youth, work, crafts and culture to the world.&#13;
The Regional Museum of Emigration is dedicated to the memory of Pietro Conti, who was the first President of the Regione Umbria—head of the regional administrative authority office—and is the first Museum completely dedicated to this subject. The unique collection of materials documents Italian emigration abroad, from the end of the 19th century up to the 1960s.&#13;
The Museum is also a Research Center, which leads studies and research on migration movements of the Umbrian population. It absolves the function of a didactic laboratory, and the schools participating in the project are numerous. In addition, publications are produced on the subject.&#13;
The documentation center has a Video Library, collecting catalogued audio-visual documentaries and news reports. The RAI—Italian Radio and Television broadcaster—also contributed to implementing the material collected by duplicating and donating everything they had on the subject to the Museum. Even TVs from other countries have done the same, contributing to the aim of the Museum of collecting as much material as possible to build a Video Library that is a national reference point. Moreover, the Library collects all the texts and volumes relating to the phenomena of migration, with particular concern for the migration of the Italian people abroad.&#13;
The exhibition itinerary travels back in time: the arrival, the journey and the departure. The first section immediately introduces the visitor into the daily life of the emigrant abroad: the aggregation in community, food, religion, employment, and particularly to the reconstruction of the kind of work done in Iron and Coalmines. The central subject of the second section is the migrant’s journey: rare and moving images of transoceanic crossings, display monitors emerge from old cardboard suitcases and trunks, bell sounds recounting precious testimonies of arduous and perilous journeys aboard in slow and packed ships. Finally, the third section deals with the departure and the reasons that led millions of Italians to migrate to foreign countries: difficulties in integration, the production of the many documents required to not be rejected at the border, Identity cards with fingerprints, passports, “able body” health certificates."

The Museum displays the different phases of the traditional production of tin-glazed ceramics and preserves important work samples of the Master Giorgio Andreoli.&#13;
Consistent with the important local ceramic tradition, the collection includes works dating from the 16th century to the 1950s. The Plate representing St Anthony from Padua dated 1531 and signed, on both sides, by the Master Giorgio Andreoli is among these. Andreoli was active in Gubbio between 1495 and 1555, and was among the first artists in Italy to adopt the Luster, a peculiar technique coming from the Islamic world that gives to the surface of earthenware—majolica—the iridescent of ruby-red—typical of the production in Gubbio—yellow, green and golden reflexes."

The Museo Diocesano is in the historical city center of Gubbio, between the Cathedral of the Santi Giacomo and Mariano and Palazzo Ducale, built by the order of Federico da Montefeltro at the end of the 14th century.&#13;
The Museum display is organized inside the Palazzo del Capitolo dei Canonici. The original palace was built in the 13th century, but in later times has been enlarged. It hosted the Chapter of the Canons, whose role was to celebrate the liturgical functions in the Duomo, and whose community life was regulated by the rule of St Ubald. Inside the architectural complex, a unique and fascinating structure, the visitor can follow a journey back in time to the origins and through the history of the ancient Diocese of Gubbio.&#13;
Marbles from ancient Roman, Byzantine and Early Medieval Ages alternate in the spaces with paintings from the 14th and 15th centuries—periods in which the local artistic production was particularly flourishing—and precious ecclesiastical furnishings and liturgical vestments. The collection is composed of objects coming from the Cathedral, from other religious buildings in town and the periphery, and of some pieces of private property.&#13;
In the archaeological section there are Roman funerary steles, gravestones and slabs.&#13;
Among the paintings, the Plates of Mello from Gubbio—an artist active around 1330-1360—depicting the Madonna with Child, distinguish themselves. It is evident that much is owed to Ambrogio Lorenzetti, who was also a frequent reference point for other local painters, so much so as to draw the conclusion that there must have been other works of the Sienese painter in the area, now lost.&#13;
The 15th century is well represented by works of painters in the circle of Ottaviano Nelli and by a fresco cycle with scenes of the Passion of Christ, coming from the Crypt of the Church of Santa Maria dei Laici, while, the subsequent centuries are represented by works of Benedetto Nucci, Ignazio Danti, Pomaracio, Francesco Allegroni and Sassoferrato.&#13;
Of particular interest is the Cope of Marcello II, Bishop of Gubbio between 1544 and 1555, of Flemish manufacture from the 15th century, probably executed based on a design of Giusto from Gand. &#13;
To complete the collection, there are a series of reliquaries and ecclesiastical furnishings, silverware and Bishop insignias including a Silver Reliquary of the True Cross of Giovanni Giardino, whose design is preserved in the Art Library Kunstbibliothek of Berlin.&#13;
From Via Federico da Montefeltro it is possible to note, behind a fence, a huge wine wooden barrel of the 15th century. It had the capacity to contain 200 hectoliters—almost 387 barrels—and was called Botte dei Canonici."

The Museo d’Arte Palazzo Ducale, MAD, is located in the highest terracing of the Town of Gubbio, in front of the Cathedral of the Santi Giacomo e Mariano.&#13;
This palace was built by Federico da Montefeltro (1422-1482), the Duke of Urbino, whose family dominated Gubbio between 1480 and 1508.&#13;
The palace undoubtedly deserves a visit for its elegant Renaissance forms, which characterize it and reminds one of Palazzo Ducale of Urbino.&#13;
In its construction, the main features of medieval buildings and space, including the famous Longobard “Court” and a vast room pertinent to the ancient Communal palace, were transformed into Renaissance forms. Probably conceived of by Luciano Laurana and Francesco di Giorgio Martini, the complex was terminated in 1480, the year in which it was solemnly donated from the town to the Duke. The Floor Plan shows two different building bodies connected by a central court—contained on three sides by an elegant portico in sandstone and bricks. The interior partially preserves original decorative elements, such as some doors, fireplaces of fine taste and caisson ceilings. Some rooms are dedicated to temporary exhibitions, the Main Floor—Piano Nobile—is under reorganization. Along the visit itinerary it is possible to enter the area dedicated to the archaeological section below.&#13;
The original inlaid-wood Studiolo—a room intended for meditation and study—interior was completely dismantled at the beginning of the 19th century: in fact, the 15th century Studiolo inlayed by the Workshop of Giuliano di Maiano, is now displayed in the Metropolitan Museum of New York. However, visitors can admire a faithful reproduction of it executed by a local artisan company."

The Raccolta delle Memorie Ubaldiane is held in Sant’Ubaldo Convent up on Mount Igino.

It also refers to the renowned Festa dei Ceri—St. Ubald Day—a popular celebration that has been performed every 15 May—on the eve of his death—in Gubbio for 800 years.&#13;
Among the works exhibited, apart from the paintings, wooden objects and votive items, there are preserved woven manufactured vestments, found inside the reliquary where the body of the Saint was kept. In particular, there is a “dirty, lacerated and patched white gown of rude cloth, with unmatched sleeves” of flax and a yellow silk and flax drape with a red decoration, depicting a series of birds and rampant lions, facing each other in alternated and parallel rows, framed by a rigid geometrical structure called “wolf tooth”, both dating from the 13th century."

&#13;
The Museo della Pesca sul Lago Trasimeno is located along the main road crossing San Feliciano, a&#13;
characteristic burgh right on the lake’s shore.&#13;
The origin and evolution of Lake Trasimeno, which came into existence one million, seven hundred thousand years ago when, as a consequence of tectonic motions, a depression in the soil that collected the water was created, is illustrated. In the course of the centuries, the shorelines of the lake have undergone a number of changes, as a consequence of such unpredictable variations. Braccio da Montone ordered the creation of an artificial emissary in the 15th century. A second emissary was then realized in the 20th century. The overexploitation of this emissary is the cause of the lowering of the level of the water in recent years.&#13;
The Museum display is arranged into four large rooms—Dawn, Noon, Afternoon and Evening—dedicated to fishing techniques from prehistory to present-day. The terracotta weights for gillnetting and trawling; dating from the Bronze Age and the Etruscan-Roman period, and the stone fishing baits of prehistoric ages are interesting in this regard. Among the watercolor paintings it is worth mentioning the work of Elio Pasquali, representing the fishing technique called “gorro”, performed with a large trawling net, and the one representing the processing of some swamp plants. Up until a few decades ago these were used to make nets, baskets and ropes for fishing. There is also the craftsmanship work of producing wicker chairs and covers for demijohns and flasks.&#13;
The development of fishing practices on lakes historically follows the spreading of Christianity. In fact, new fishing techniques started to be experimented in this epoch with the appearance of stable fishing areas, to confront a larger demand for fish coming from the town of Perugia, in particular during the period of Lent.&#13;

&#13;
The Torre dei Lambardi stands on top of a hill, overlooking the town of Magione, in a position from where it is possible to enjoy a beautiful panoramic view of Perugia and Lake Trasimeno.&#13;
The tower was erected, between the 12th and the 13th century, by the Templar Knights of Jerusalem, called “gerosolimitani”—i.e. from Jerusalem. It is three-stories-high—30 meters approximately—and has two mezzanines and a panoramic terrace. It has a squared floor plan that was originally a buttress in defense of the entrance door, and there is a bastion-like construction at its base.&#13;
Between the end of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, the Lambardi Tower progressively lost its military and strategic importance. After alternate fortunes, it was restored by the municipality of Magione in the 1980s that uses the edifice and its rooms for displays and exhibitions."

The Dynamic Museum of Brickworks and Terracotta is a starting point for an itinerary that includes the entire municipal area, including the production sites of Compignano and San Fortunato—old kilns documenting the pre-industrial production of bricks—and the museums of the Antenne Museali of Compignano and Spina, exhibition sites that are documentation centers for the traditions of the territory. The rooms of the restored Pietromarchi Palace have hosted the display of a number of brickworks since 2004, i.e. the bricks, roofing tiles and the materials for building in general, as well as the decorative terracotta of common use that has characterized the production documented in the municipal area from the Roman period up to the present days.

&#13;
The Catacomba di Villa San Faustino lays in the locality of Grotta Traiana, near the small village of Villa San Giustino, in the Municipality of Massa Martana, at a short distance from the ancient route of Via Flaminia and Ponte Fonnaia Bridge.&#13;
This is the sole Catacomb known in Umbria, and is a precious evidence of the spreading of Christianity, which had already arrived in Umbria around the 4th century A.D., by means of the Flaminian Way. The definitive arrangement of the entrance and the long gallery makes the visit easier. The gallery leads to the hypogeal chamber, based on the system of loculi—sepulchral niches—placed on the walls, which reflects the communitarian spirit animating the early Christians.&#13;
Reported for the first time in 1691 by local scholars under the name of Grotte di Traiano—Traiano’s Caves—the catacombs were rediscovered in 1900, and around the early 1940s were the subject of two excavation campaigns, which uncovered the majority of the galleries that were later used as air-raid shelter during the WWII conflict. Restoration works done to allow visitors to enter were carried out one after the other from 1996 to 1997, during which a new area—a small funerary Basilica strictly destined for cult activities—was discovered.&#13;
The catacombs develop through a straight corridor, 22 meters long, which penetrates inside the hill and goes 7 meters deep into the ground; four galleries depart from this corridor, two on each side, and one of them has a semi-circular course. They are 1,50 meters wide and are covered by a segmental vault. A series of niches of various dimensions open in rows along the walls, one above the other. They are often sealed with large tiles, and furnished with lucerne—simple terracotta oil lamps—while on the pavement some formae have been excavated and covered with tiles, which are engraved—before firing—with circular signs. The absence of inscriptions with the names of the deceased, which are usually found on marble slabs covering the tombs, leads to the conclusion that the catacombs belonged to an illiterate sector of society. Lucernes and other materials recovered on the site suggest the area was attended around the 4th and 5th century A.D.&#13;
The practice of burying deceased people underground dates back to the Etruscans, but with Christianity ever more complex and vast hypogeal burials were created to host an entire community in a sole necropolis. The ancient term to designate these sites is coemeterium that comes from Greek and means “dormitory”. The term catacomb, originally used to designate only the important complex of San Sebastiano on Via Appia, was extended only later to all Christian cemeteries."

The medieval burgh, famous for its precious wine production and for its splendid panoramic position, dominates the entire Umbrian Valley from Perugia to Spoleto. The Museum’s display is arranged in the interior spaces of the former Chiesa di San Francesco built between 1335 and 1338—and inside the historical rooms of the annexed Convent. The current appearance of the church dates back essentially to the 15 century, when the Franciscan friars promoted its complete restructuring. The Museum has had its premises in the Chiesa di San Francesco and in the Convent annexed to it since 1990. The church was built between 1335 and 1338 and hosted a painting work-site of noticeable importance, above all for the presence of a number of works of the painter Benozzo Gozzoli, author of the decorations contained in the Cappella di San Girolamo and in the Apse. The twelve fresco scenes of The life of St Francis’—1452—are arranged in three rows—one above the other—and they are to be counted among the most important preserved painting cycles of the Renaissance, the second in order of importance after Giotto’s cycle in Assisi. The painters Jacopo Vincioli, Giovanni di Corraduccio, Ascensidonio Spacca worked on the decoration of the lateral chapels, while the painting in the backside the Annunciation with God the Father in Glory between Angels and the Nativity is a work of Pietro Vannucci, known as ""Il Perugino"". Paintings, sculptures, woven drapes and other objects coming from different places of the town and the territory have found a place in the Gallery, which is set up in some rooms of the former Convent. A part from a consistent nucleus of works from the local artist Francesco Melanzio, the Gallery takes care of detached frescoes and works executed by the circle of artists around Alunno and Antoniazzo Romano. Some archeological findings and marble gravestone fragments of various ages are reunited in the Crypt; of particular interest among them is a statue of Hercules of the Classical period whose provenance is uncertain. New spaces in the basement of the building have been opened to the public and used for temporary exhibitions since 2006.

The Complesso Museale di San Francesco reunites the Museo Civico di San Franceso and the MuseoEtnografico “Il Tamburo Parlante”, respectively the Civic Museum and the Ethnographic Museum in the same premises. It is housed in the Convent and Church of San Francesco, located in the center of Montone, at the end of a road made of a flight of steps leading from Piazza Fortebracci, the village center, to Via San Francesco, in Borgo Vecchio.&#13;
The Museum, inaugurated in 1995, is endowed with a collection of paintings of remarkable worthiness. In the Gothic church hosting it, dated from the 14th century, the original furnishing have been partly rearranged while the convent rooms have been organized to host the Historical-Artistic Collection. When entering into the church, the beautiful carved portal—work of Bencivenni da Mercatello, dating 1514—cannot pass unnoticed. The frescoes of the apse, a work of the artist Antonio Alberti from Ferrara, are interesting, even if of fragmentary conservation. Commissioned in the 1420s by the famous soldier of fortune Braccio Fortebracci, Count of Montone, the cycle is the most important evidence of the courtly culture of Braccio. Apart from the choir’s stalls, which are finely carved, a Fortebracci family votive altar, bearing a fresco depicting St Anthony from Padua among Saints of the Perugian painter Bartolomeo Caporali, is preserved on the wall to the left. The Madonna of Mercy Gonfalon, of the same artist, is displayed in the museum. The&#13;
Deposition wooden sculpture, from the Pieve di San Gregorio, dating from the 13th century, is undoubtedly among the most valuable works exhibited. A consistent collection of fabrics and liturgical goldsmith works, along with some painting executed by artists during the 16th and 17th centuries, complete the collection. The ethnographic collection called “Il Tamburo Parlante”—Talking Drum—is in the same complex. The items coming from Eastern Africa—Sudan, Ethiopia, Kenya and Tanzania—are arranged in four rooms. There are more than 600 pieces that are selected and arranged in a way that illustrates the interaction of the various African cultures in their natural environments where they developed."

It is organized into three sections: the Prehistoric and Proto-historical period, the Roman period and the Late Antiquity and Early Middle Ages.&#13;
The Prehistoric and Proto-historical section displays many Stone tools, made of flint and limestone, lithic reductions in pebbles and flakes dating back to the time of the Homo Erectus and Homo Sapiens time, in addition to fragments of earthenware and metal items in both Bronze and Iron.&#13;
The Roman section displays items in black terracotta, black varnished ceramics, marbles, inscriptions and mosaics coming from the many settlement structures and sepulchral sites spread out along the Flaminian Way, dated 220-219 B.C. &#13;
Finally, the Late Antiquity and Early Middle Ages section mainly collects finds coming from the Longobard necropolis Del Portone, one of the richest complexes in Italy, with its 165 tombs furnished with gold, silver and precious stone items, ceramics and metals. Yet, most of the finds are exhibited in the Early Middle Age Museum in Rome.&#13;
The walls of the Conference Room of the Museum are decorated by frescoes of the 15th century. This wing of the building was originally the Church of Santa Maria della Mattonata; in 569 A.D., it was transformed into a Seminary and then after several changes during the centuries became—after the Unification of Italy, in 1861—an integral part of the contiguous Municipal Palace."

The Museo Civico e Diocesano “La Castellina”—i.e. small fortress—occupies the entire western side of Piazza San Benedetto, a square in the heart of the historical center of Norcia.&#13;
The edifice, as ordered by Pope Julius III, was built in 1554 based on a design of Jacopo Barozzi da Viglola and was born as a fortified residence for papal legates and used from the beginning to control the peripheral territories for the Papal State. When the Mountain Prefecture was instituted, in 1569, La Castellina became its natural seat. Restored in the 18th century after frequent earthquakes, in 1860 it became the location for the Municipal offices until 1967, when it was transformed into a Museum.&#13;
Apart from the Museums it hosts, La Castellina is important from the architectural point of view. Visiting the Museum also means admiring its ‘container’, a powerful and compact quadrilateral stronghold.&#13;
Today, the Civic and Diocesan Museum, the Massenzi Collection and the Permanent Archaeological Exhibition “Leaving for the afterlife” are inside the fortress. The first museum reunites local works of art—liturgical items and vestments, frescoes, paintings on canvases or on wooden panels, wooden polychrome or stone sculptures, and glazed terracotta—of ecclesiastical or municipal property, dating between the 12th and the 18th century. Among these is the 13th century Wooden Cross of Petrus Pictor, coming from the small locality of Campi, or the majestic altarpiece of Antonio da Faenza with The Madonna and Child and Franciscan Saints (1519), which was originally in the Church of the Santissima Annunziata.&#13;
The stone sculptures of The Madonna with Child and SS John the Baptist and John the Evangelist (1469), coming from the Church of San Giovanni, are the work of Giovanni Dalmata, while the refined sculptural group in glazed terracotta—from the beginning of the 16th century—of The Annunciation is attributed to Luca Della Robbia. Donated in 2002 to the Museum, the Massenzi Collection—one of the largest private collections of Umbria—is predominantly formed of bronze finds and Etruscan, Greek and, to a smaller extent, Magna Graecia Vases, dating from the 9th century to the Roman Age. A polychrome terracotta statue attributed to Jacopo della Quercia also belongs to the donation.&#13;
Finally, there has been a Permanent Archaeological Exhibition entitled “Leaving for the afterlife”, consisting of a recent discovery of rich funerary goods, dating between the end of the 4th and the 1st century B.C., in the Hellenistic necropolises of Colle dell’Annunziata, Popoli and Piano di Santa Scolastica since 2003."

From the museum premises it is possible to walk or ride a bike along the Le Marcite meadow. This is a peculiar ecosystem, unique in the central-southern Apennines area, which was created by the irrigation system of channels and wooden pound locks built by the Benedictine monks in the 5th—6th century to flood cultivable fields. With this system of irrigation, which can change every season, it is possible to always keep the field humid during the summer and avoid freezing during the winter, making cultivation possible even during less favorable months."

&#13;
Inaugurated in 2001, the Museo del Tulle ""Anita Belleschi Grifoni"" has its premises in the 1500s Church of Sant'Agostino, in Panicale, restored so that it could conserve and exhibit the numerous embroidered Tulle manufactured articles that had been spread around in private hands and in town churches.&#13;
Embroidery on Tulle was a needle activity, performed with material such as cotton and silk. It was already widespread starting from the first decades of the 19th century, thanks to the improvement in technique made by the English Heathcoat and Lurley, in 1809, with the introduction of a loom that mechanically produced Tulle, a very fine and vaporous netting fabric, which is light but at the same time very resistant. Tulle in fact is a fabric characterized by the typical machine made structure of interlaced fibers—producing small hexagonal designs—called ""bobbinet"", a perfect base for laces. This embroidery technique, born to offer a production similar to the hand made one, like the needle-lace or the ""Tombolo"" and ""Fuselli""—respectively ‘pillow’ and ‘bobbins’—made lace, was practiced by the nuns of the Collegio delle Vergini di Panicale and taught to the young girls, pupils of the College up until 1872, year of its closure.&#13;
During the 1930s, this traditional activity was revived by Anita Belleschi Grifoni, a lady from Panicale who improved the techniques, revised designs and simplified the stitches.&#13;
Convinced of the economic and social potentiality of this traditional activity, an exclusively women's activity, Anita Belleschi Grifoni founded a school and created its trademark, the ""Ars Panicalensis"". From the beginning, 1936, the company entered into a sort of collaboration with the ENAPI—Ente Nazionale per l'Artigianato e le Piccole Industrie—and also entered into contact with many contemporary artists, who produced designs and models to reproduce in the form of laces.  Thanks to Anita's initiative and to her numerous social relations, but also to the contained cost of the manufactured products, the Ars Panicalensis embroidery became célèbre among nobles and the families of the middle class and higher classes, to the point that some of its samples were also sold to the royal family of Savoia and to the princes of Torlonia.&#13;
The school, like previous and analogous experiences of the region, also had the aim of providing women with their own economic independence and personal self-realization through the production and commercialization of their handmade work. After the death of Anita Belleschi Grifoni and the closure of her school, some lace makers continued to keep this traditional technique alive."

The Museo della Madonna della Sbarra is hosted inside the homonymous Church, which stands right outside the burgh of Panicale, along the road going down towards Lake Trasimeno. This Church was built in 1625 to shelter a sacred image of the Virgin Mary, discovered in the 16th century, where the old custom station with its trade barrier—a bar that in Italian is called ""sbarra""—used to be, right on the passageway. The sacred image was therefore called Madonna della Sbarra, and the later built temple inherited this name too. As demanded by the townspeople, the church is still under Municipal care, which still preserves the old accounting books that go up to 1860 in the archives.&#13;
Its façade, made of red bricks with pilasters in white sandstone, is in Tuscan style. In the interior, the church has a three-nave structure, in Baroque style. &#13;
Worth mentioning is the central altar, covered by stucco decorations it is surmounted by four gilded angels supporting a tympana, which holds the old fresco depicting the Virgin inside. The building hosts a conspicuous collection of furnishings and liturgical vestments, donated by the generous devotion of the townspeople. The rich donation served to decorate the main altar and the other four lateral ones during every liturgical period. There is also a Madonna wooden sculpture, which has various clothes of different colors, to be used following the appropriate liturgical requirements, and a number of chalices, patens, turibles of various forms, monstrance and reliquaries."

Apart from this, there are other kinds of boats for fishing coming from Lake Piediluco, Padule di Fucecchio in Tuscany, near Lucca, and from Stagno di Cabras in Sardinia.&#13;
The most important pieces are the “monossili”—from the Greek “monoxylon”—two dugout canoes made from a hallowed oak tree trunk, which date from the 13th century. They were found along the Passignano coastline, after the dredging done on the Lake’s shoreline.&#13;
The exhibited items are furnished with 21 thematic panels describing the general framework and an archaeological, historical and linguistic reading of the contents."

The Cappella di San Severo stands next to the small Church of San Severo, in Rione di Porta Sole, the highest point in the city of Perugia. &#13;
The Chapel preserves the sole work left among the many that Raphael executed for the town of Perugia. It is a fresco depicting The Trinity and the SS Maurus, Placidus, Benedict Martyr and John the Monk, commissioned in 1505 by the Bishop Troilo Baglioni. The work, which was left unfinished by Raphael when Pope Julius II called him to Rome, was completed by—the then old—Pietro Vannucci, Il Perugino, in 1521. The SS Scholastica, Jerome and John the Evangelist, Gregory the Great, Boniface and Martha depicted on the lower part of the fresco are attributed to him."

The Uguccione Ranieri di Sorbello Foundation has its premises in the Casa-Museo Palazzo Sorbello, in Piazza Piccinino, right in the historical center of Perugia, at a short walking distance from Palazzo dei Priori and San Lorenzo Cathedral, between the Etruscan Well and the Church of San Severo. The Palace Burbon di Sorbello, which houses the Museum, dates back to the 16th century and over time has been the property of several historical families—among them the Montemelini and the Oddi—until, in 1780, Giuseppe I of Burbon di Sorbello moved there with his family. &#13;
The visit allows one to have access to the preserved evidence of the intellectual life and the artistic taste of the Umbrian aristocracy of the 18th and 19th centuries.&#13;
Landscape paintings, family portraits and paintings of Authors—including Vittorio Alfieri and François-Xavier Fabre portraits—are part of the conserved collections. In the rich library, rare editions—such as the Encyclopédie Française of Diderot et D’Alembert (1770) and the original edition of the Tragedie of the Italian poet, Alfieri—are preserved. A 19th century Ginori table service and some Meissen and Dresden molded figurines stand out in the porcelain collection.

The Fuseum in Perugia, in the locality of Monte Malbe, is a “park-museum” that holds a collection of almost 150 works of Brajo Fuso (1899-1980), an artist but also practitioner from Perugia.
After his figurative debut, Brajo moved towards experimentation focusing on color and gesture potentiality—anticipating Jackson Pollock’s Action Painting—and later that of matter, up to the point of becoming one of the most significant representatives of the so called “Art of Machine Parts and Scrap Metal” and of “found” objects.
The name Fuseum comes from the fusion between the artist’s name “Fuso” and the word “museum”, as desired by the artist himself and his wife, Elisabetta Rampielli—a painter herself—who built starting from 1960, in the Holm-oak woods in the northern side of town, a complex full of sculptures realized with the most disparate materials, a work of art executed in an arch of time of twenty years, composed of many parts independent from each other. With the death of the artist, the property shifted to the Sodalizio di San Martino—an old charitable and cultural institution in town that was founded in 1574—following his testamentary will.
In the “Gallery”, starting from 2008 a rich selection of works of Fuso has been gathered: eleven rooms, already arranged by the artist himself, host the nucleus of objects subdivided into cycles—such as The Chromatic Strata Cycle, The Chromic Acid Cycle, Chromate Objects, Wooden Objects, Metal-Plastics Objects and so on—and the so called “Coccibus”, which contains the bulk of his production of ceramics and his early figurative works, or the “Pittocromo”, which reconstructs the artist’s atelier with most of his tools and materials used to realize his bizarre compositions."

The Galleria Nazionale dell’Umbria is hosted in the upper floors of Palazzo dei Priori, with the entrance in Corso Vannucci. Born from the original nucleus of works from the local Academy of Fine Arts of Perugia—second half of the 16th century—the collection grew significantly between the end of the 1700s and the first half of the 1800s, and later was further enriched as a consequence of the suppression of the religious orders by the Unitarian State.&#13;
The current Museum arrangement, inaugurated in December 2006, occupies a surface of 4,000sq meters distributed on two levels. The prestigious collection, chronologically ordered, includes a wide variety of works, which range from paintings on wooden panels, canvases and frescoes, to sculptures in wood and marble, to goldsmiths and fabrics, all highly representative of Italian artistic production between the 13th and 19th century.&#13;
Among the masterpieces of the medieval and Renaissance periods, the works of Arnolfo di Cambio, Nicola and Giovanni Pisano, Duccio di Boninsegna, Gentile Da Fabriano, Beato Angelico, Benozzo Gozzoli, Piero della Francesca and Francesco di Giorgio Martini stand out. Much space is given to Umbrian painters such as Benedetto Bonfigli, Bartolomeo Caporali and Fiorenzo di Lorenzo, and in particular to the renowned paintings of Perugino, Pintoricchio and their pupils and followers. Some sections are dedicated to the masterpieces of the Sienese goldsmiths and to the traditional “Perugian tablecloth”, to the production of ceramics and floor tiles of the 15th and 16th centuries and to the collection of drawings, among them a precious sanguine and ink Sketch by Federico Barocci. The display path continues with painting and sculptural evidence from the 1600s, 1700s and 1800s, among them the works of Pietro da Cortona, Orazio Gentileschi, Francesco Trevisani and Sebastiano Conca, and concludes with the thematic exhibitions dedicated to 19th century Perugian topography and the Carattoli Collection."

The Necropoli del Palazzone is located today in a well-equipped archaeological area, with visit pathways and an Antiquarium that hosts some finds and thematic displays of the Etruscans’ daily life. The cemetery, located 7 kilometers to the southwest of Perugia—in the modern suburb of Ponte San Giovanni—was connected with a settlement supervising a portion of the Tiber Valley below. It consists of about 200 chamber-like tombs excavated in the natural soil. Inside the necropolis, the Volumni Hypogeum, distinguished for the complexity of its internal arrangement and decorative commitment, belonged to the “Volumni”, i.e. the rich Velimna family. The sepulcher—one of the most significant examples of the funerary architecture of the Hellenistic Age—reproducing the Roman Domus’ canonic disposition of rooms, housed, inside the main body called “tablinum”, seven cinerary depositions, all kept inside urns, whose lids reproduce the portrait-like-features of the deceased. The necropolis dates mostly to the Hellenistic Age—between the 3rd and 1st century B.C.—while a small number, a nucleus of five—in two different areas—dates from the second half of the 6th beginning of the 5th century B.C., i.e. the Archaic Age."

It is hosted in the 13th century Church of San Francesco delle Donne, one of the oldest Franciscan Friar settlements in Italy. Raised where St Francis used to sojourn, it owes its name—Women’s Church of St Francis—to the fact that in 1252 the complex was handed over from the Friars to a community of Benedictine Nuns.&#13;
The Laboratory was founded in 1921 by Giuditta Brozzetti, an outstanding representative of the entrepreneurship of women in the Umbrian capital. Today, her heirs maintain the tradition by producing hand made—with manual looms—fabrics and cloths decorated with medieval and Renaissance patterns. Among the preserved items in the laboratory are three traditional manual four-heddle-looms, which probably date from the 17th to the 19th century; eight Jacquard looms—Patented by Vincenzi—and two 17th century looms for the weaving of the so-called “Punto Fiamma di Perugia” stitch, not counting designs and cardboards documenting the production of the Laboratory from its origins up to nowadays."

The Mosaico Romano, commonly called of Sant’Elisabetta, owes its name to the Church close by to where it was found. Today the mosaic is inside the Faculty of Science, Mathematics, Physics and Natural Science of the University of Perugia, in Via Pascoli, in the area called the “Conca”. It was part of a thermal complex realized outside of the Etruscan town wall belt, in an area rich with water, and is one of the most important monuments of the Roman Age in town.&#13;
The Mosaic—14,10 by 8,10 meters—realized with black and white tesserae and framed with a double band of black tesserae delimiting its borders, depicts the mythological figure of Orpheus while taming wild beasts with the notes of his lyre. The abundance of anatomic details in all 40 animals depicted, of all kind of species, reveals a technique of high artistic level, executed by skilful Roman artists.&#13;
The complex had a long life and was probably transformed into a building of Christian Cult, as is testified by the presence of an apse and, on the floor surface near the rhinoceros, of two sculpted cross signs. The same theme, with Orpheus, was a subject dear to Christians for its symbolic meaning; it was allegorically compared with the words of God calling and attracting humanity to him. The definitive abandonment of the area happened because of a fire at the beginning of the 6th century A.D."

&#13;
The Museo Archeologico Nazionale premises are hosted inside the San Domenico former Convent, located along Corso Cavour, just outside the Etruscan walls of Perugia.&#13;
Since 1948 the Museum has occupied the area of the Dominican Convent complex, built over an earlier 13th century church that stood where the main cloister is today, which in the course of the centuries has been enlarged up to the point of assuming its current aspect. With the occupation of the Napoleonic troops and the Italian process of unification, the complex was transformed to host military barracks, changing dramatically the original design: the cavalry was housed in the cloister, the stables were placed in the oratory and the old church was transformed into a refectory on two levels.&#13;
At the end of the Second World War the complex was occupied by the German militias, then by the Allied troops and at the end by the refugees. Since 1945, having been handed over to the Municipality, it has become a place of culture by hosting the State Archives and the Civic Museums.&#13;
Apart from admiring the architectural complex of San Domenico, whose cloister—one among the largest and outstanding in town—allows the view of the church’s imposing tower bell, the visit to the Archaeological Museum represents a precious opportunity to be acquainted with the collections of Etruscan finds, which are among the richest of Italy, gathered above all in the course of the 19th century excavations in the necropolises of Perugia’s territory. Next to the most ancient finds, the visitors can appreciate the numerous materials coming from the excavations that followed the birth of the Superintendence of the Archaeological Heritage (1964) that are presented to the public as per the most modern exhibition criteria. Furthermore, a consistent amount of pre-historical finds completes the display path.&#13;
The Museum hosts the pre-historical and Etruscan-Roman collections, which were gathered starting from the 19th century by the illustrious scholars who as curators took over the responsibility of managing and preserving the archaeological heritage of the town, which at the time was an important center for Etruscan archaeological studies. The central nucleus of the exhibition mostly contains material coming from the territory and the excavations in the necropolises of Perugia, which can be dated from the Archaic and the Hellenistic Ages, like the Cai Cutu Sarcophagus in Sperandio and the exceptional complex of archaic bronze coming from Castel San Mariano, not counting the Cutu hypogeum reconstructed—as per the original arrangement—in a separate section located in the basement. Both levels of the Loggia in the cloister display the Etruscan-Roman Lapidarium composed of many cinerary urns, funerary “cippus”—i.e. memorial stones—and marble slabs with Latin inscriptions. Pre-proto-historical material from diverse contexts in central Italy—Umbria, Tuscany, Marche and The Abruzzi—along with the Bellucci Collection and the finds from the settlement of the Tuscan village of Cetona are placed in the upper floor. In the large “Hall of the Bronzes”, which has hosted for almost half a century the rich collections of proto-historical items that belonged to Giuseppe Bellucci and Umberto Calzoni, a new section has been arranged following the most recent museum criteria. This section illustrates the dynamics of the development of the Umbrian and Etruscan civilizations, the former settled on the left riverbank of the Tiber, while the latter on the right side, and figuratively the central corridor represents the river."

The Museo del Capitolo di San Lorenzo is located in Piazza IV Novembre, Perugia’s main square, right in front of the Fontana Maggiore and next to the entrance of the Cathedral. This museum was reopened in 2000, after significant interventions of restoration had noticeably widened its exhibition space.&#13;
Instituted in 1923, the Museum collection consists of works coming from the Cathedral and the churches of the Diocese, such as: goldsmiths, liturgical vestments and fittings, paintings and sculptures testifying the artistic production from the 11th to the 19th century.&#13;
In the Lapidarium, held in the recently restored underground halls, probably part of what once was the Palace of Martino IV, numerous archaeological pieces are displayed. The exhibited fragments, which date from the 13th to the 16th century, come from the ancient cathedral and the worship edifices around it.&#13;
The rich Art Gallery it possesses is second in Perugia, for the number of works conserved, only to the National Gallery of Umbria. The works worth signaling are: St Onofrius Altarpiece painted by Luca Singorelli for the Cathedral in 1484, which is the sole work of the painter—who was born in Cortona—for the town of Perugia, the Deacon Head sculpted by Arnolfo di Cambio, the architectonic fragment attributed to Giovanni Pisano’s workshop, the two Triptychs of Meo da Siena and Agnolo Gaddi, the Pieta of Bartolomeo Caporali and the Marriage of the Virgin of Carlo Labruzzi, painted in 1815 to substitute the painting on St Joseph Altar by Perugino that was requisitioned by the Napoleonic troops in 1797.&#13;
Guided Visits right below the Cathedral have led visitors to the discovery of an underground archaeological pathway—for a length of at least one Kilometer—since January 2011. In fact the Cathedral was built on top of the Etruscan town terracing. The Guided Visits allow the visitor to observe the several layers defining the different epochs of the town: Etruscan, Roman, Late Antiquity and Medieval.&#13;
The excavations have brought to light the majestic retaining wall of the terrace, built with a technique that is similar to that of the Etruscan Walls, but better preserved.&#13;
The presence of worship sites in the area, dating back to the archaic period—6th-4th century B.C.—is testified by the presence of the remnants of the foundation of their structures and by the polychrome terracotta decorations of the temples—the Silenus head sculpted antefixes—exhibited in the National Archaeological Museum of Perugia today.&#13;
At the foot of the terracing, a stretch of road of “basolato”—i.e. made of slabs of black lava stones—part of an important route axis of the Etruscan-Roman Town reconnects with the part found a long time ago under Piazza Cavallotti. &#13;
Probably starting in byzantine times, the terracing was exploited for defensive purposes, and progressively—during the 10th century—around the Cathedral, a series of monumental buildings, towers and palaces started to be raised, the “Castle of San Lorenzo”, as it was called in the medieval documents."

After 1974, it has also been the exhibition premises of prestigious collections of art, arranged in three sections: The Gipsoteca, i.e. a gallery collecting gypsum plaster copies of famous sculptures; The Art Gallery; and The Gabinetto, i.e. the department of prints and drawings.&#13;
The first nucleus of the collections consists of the monumental gypsum plaster copies of The Dawn and Dusk, and The Day and Night, works of Michelangelo Buonarroti—held in the Medici Chapel in Florence, in the complex of the San Lorenzo Basilica—casted and donated in the 16th century by the Perugian Vincenzo Danti. In Napoleonic times, the works from the suppressed Religious Congregations became part of the first nucleus of the Art Collection Heritage of the Academy, which later on would become the National Gallery of Umbria. The Academy has been the guide and artistic engine of Umbrian creativity, by having increased its collections with donations from organizations and private individuals—especially from artists and academics--ever since the Unification of Italy.&#13;

The Museo Palazzo della Penna is in the historical center of Perugia, at a short distance from the Tre Archi crossroad and the powerful southern bastion of the Rocca Paolina fortress.&#13;
The Palace, the 16th century patrician residence of the Della Penna family, was built to a sober size over a centuries-old-architectural stratification, testifying the complex urban evolution of the area, from the Etruscan-Roman age up to recent years. The remnants of an Amphitheater and an ancient Roman road, in the course of time, were superimposed by medieval constructions, Late-Renaissance masonries and unifying rearrangements, all in layers, up to an aesthetic Neoclassical restructuring, in its turn followed by a later updating intervention executed at the end of 1970s—aimed at rendering the edifice compatible with the new destination of use—to transform it into a Palace of Culture and the Museum of the Town.&#13;
The emergence of Della Penna Palace as the museum of the town and the palace of culture has become particularly concrete in recent years, supported by an uninterrupted series of exhibitions and cultural activities that accompany the arrangement of four permanent diverse collection displays, which taken as a whole forms a suggestive and structured visit itinerary that goes from the Baroque period to the 1900s.&#13;
The display includes three different sections. The first one, hosted in the beautiful halls frescoed by Antonio Castelletti in 1812, is dedicated to Gerardo Dottori (1884-1977), a futurist painter who adhered to Marinetti’s artistic movement in 1912 and was a central figure for the creation of the current of artists dedicated to the “Aeropittura”, i.e. landscape viewed from high above as if flying. Walking down the beautiful staircase designed by the architect Franco Minissi we enter the first floor below ground where—after having gone through the Amphitheater remnants—the frescoed halls host the Roman Baroque works part of the Valentino Martinelli Collection, among which stands out the Damned Soul—in papier mâché—and the Tied Christ of Gian Lorenzo Bernini. On the second floor below ground, there are Six Black Boards designed by Joseph Beuys to illustrate his theories, left by the artist on the occasion of a public event—the 3 April 1980 meeting with Alberto Burri—organized at the Rocca Paolina, in Perugia."

&#13;
The Museo Storico della Perugina is in San Sisto, a suburban locality—not far from the city center of Perugia—close to the Perugia-Madonna Alta exit from the Perugia-Bettolle highway. &#13;
Born in 1997, as a branch of the Buitoni-Perugina Historical Archive, on the occasion of the ninetieth anniversary of the foundation of the well-known confectionery company, the Museum illustrates the history of the Enterprise and its famous products. Together with the industrial machinery for the confectionery in use since 1907, three multimedia desks are at the disposal of the visitor to illustrate the cocoa-chocolate manufacture processing, life within the company between the 1930s and the 1950s and the strategies and techniques of company communication. Apart from the numerous classical product presentation boxes, the pioneering advertising campaigns done starting from the 1930s—innovative both for the tools and the then new means of communication used—are illustrated—i.e. the Radio, the shows and the contests, up to the Television, where famous sketches appeared in the evening program called “Carosello”, very well known to Italians."

Built between 1452 and 1457 inside the new wing of Palazzo dei Priori of Perugia, it was the seat of the moneychangers. From the Hall of the Lawyers’ Guild, called Sala dei Legisti—with its court represented on the back wall, and the lateral wooden stalls inlaid and carved by Gian Pietro Zuccari—it is possible to enter into the Hall of Hearings, called Sala delle Udienze, which was a room destined for meetings and public reception. Half of the wall to the right is occupied by the court and by the counters executed by Domenico Tasso, while the rest of the walls host the cycle of frescoes of Pietro Vannucci, called Perugino, executed between 1498 and 1500. Inspired by an iconographic program of the Perugian humanist Francesco Maturanzio, the cycle depicts Mythological Figures—on the vaults—Greek and Roman Illustrious Personalities, the Liberal Arts, Sibyls and Prophets—on the left and on the right walls—while—on the back wall—the Christ Transfiguration and The Crèche are represented. From here, it is possible to enter the Chapel dedicated to St John the Baptist, decorated with the frescoes of Giannicola di Paolo."

&#13;
The Pozzo Etrusco is an ancient Etruscan well assimilated into the basement of the 17th century Palazzo Bourbon-Sorbello, standing at the extreme eastern end of Piazza Danti, at the foot of the most elevated part of the historical center of Perugia, called Monte di Porta Sole, which corresponds to the ancient acropolis of the town.&#13;
It represents the most monumental of the water infrastructural constructions in town. It was built in Etruscan times and had a dual function, as a well and a cistern. Its position coincided with what was once the east-west route axis that connected the arch of Arco dei Gigli with the gate of Porta San Luca. Visiting the well is complementary to the visit to the City Gates and Walls Museum, which offers further evidence of the level of urban development attained by Perugia during the Etruscan period.&#13;
Constructed with the same blocks of Travertine as the wall belt, it was excavated into the so called “tassello mandorlato”—a coarse-grained sedimentary rock composed of rounded fragments—that is typical of the town. The well is composed of a cylindrical shaft more than 30 meters deep with a maximum diameter of 5,60 meters, which narrows while going down—like a funnel—into the lower part. It presents two trusses, “capriate”, supporting its roof, each one consists of four large blocks of travertine—two horizontal and two oblique—held together by a central keystone. This system, which is technically very similar to the cistern in Via Caporali on the opposite side of the city, served to support a floor pavement made of stone slabs of travertine where an opening allowed water to be drawn from. This work of engineering, whose centrality and monumentality does not leave doubt as to its public destination of use, dates—basing the judgment on the technical similarities found with the wall belt—from the 3rd century B.C.&#13;
Its maximum capacity is estimated to be 424.000 liters of water and it was the largest among the wells and cisterns in town, all of which were in use until the construction of the first public aqueduct in the 13th century."

&#13;
The Nobile Collegio della Mercanzia premises are inside the original nucleus of Palazzo dei Priori, in Perugia. It occupies two rooms on the ground floor, which open on Corso Vannucci. Its name is due to the ancient Guild of the Merchants, who established their premises inside Palazzo dei Priori starting around the 1390s.&#13;
It is a rare example of the originality and conservation of wooden decorations, made of “formelle”, inlaid panels—with a minimal recourse to coloring or gilding—of precious wood that reveals the influence of Nordic expertise in the use of wood.&#13;
The Guild of the Art of the Merchants had among its duties that of exercising justice by settling disputes between merchants, supervising weight and measures and administering the Commune by guaranteeing the tutelage of public liberties. During the first decennials of the 15th century the corporation decided to decorate the Hall of the Hearings, in its entirety, with an elegant oak or poplar wooden coating, inlaid and probably the work of some craftsman coming from transalpine countries. The wall decoration is almost entirely made of wooden panels, with quatrefoil frames, of oak and poplar wood. Two exceptions are a small pulpit on the central left wall surmounted by the figures of Prudence, Fortitude, Justice and Temperance and the first part of the main wall to the right, which is decorated by two blind double lancet windows, “bifore”, and a rich fretwork. In the lunette there is the Merchants Guild Coat of Arms: the Perugian Griffin with a bale, and a double order seat reserved for the Merchant Consuls. In front, there is a counter, work of Costanzo Mattiolo, a Perugian artist. Inside the next Archive the splendid Registers of Membership dated 1323, 1356 and 1599 are held and preserved."

&#13;
The Museo del Vetro of Piegaro is arranged inside the ancient glassmaking factory that dates from the early 1800s, located in the historical center of the village. It has been restored maintaining the architecture and the original arrangement of its rooms unchanged. It is one of the few examples of pre-industrial structures preserved in Italy for glassmaking. Its exhibition displays glass produced here over the centuries, such as: glasses, bottles, finely refined carafes, hand made items—some of which have decorations in gold—demijohns and flasks covered by wickerwork that have characterized the production of the factory over time.&#13;
The itinerary of the visit follows the old production cycles, from the arrival of the raw material up to the final product, passing through the phases of the fusion of the glass, at first manual blowing and then the semiautomatic manufacture.&#13;
The two rooms of the main floor, which still preserve the smoked walls, are built around the remnants of the furnace. The basement, in the past used mainly as a deposit for raw material and for the final products, preserves an intact hypocaust system for the circulation of the heat below the furnace. At the center of the main room there is an imposing pool full of green melted glass, which was left on the occasion of the definitive turning-off of the furnace, in 1968. Thanks to the rich illustrative multimedia apparatus, the technical aspects of the glass production, from antiquity to contemporary times, together with the history of Piegaro and its territorial area, which has always closely been connected with the glass industries, are shown in detail. Some interesting documents from the 13th-14th century testify that much of the glass employed in the stained glasses and mosaics in the Duomo of Orvieto came from Piegaro."

Coordinated and led by the Guardia Forestale dello Stato, the Museum had its foundation laid down thanks to the collections of Silvio Bambini, a bus conductor from Città di Castello who—at the end of the 1970s—by making contact with local hunters and others succeeded in recovering a number of rare species of birds and mammals from the local environment, the majority of which are protected by law today.

&#13;
The Museo dell’Abbazia di Sant’Eutizio is located in Val Castoriana, at a short distance from the medieval burgh of Preci.&#13;
The exhibition is held in some of the halls of the Sant’Eutizio Abbey complex, maybe where the early primitive nucleus of the abbey was, as revealed during restoration work after the 1997 earthquake. The 1500 years of life of this monastery have produced a suggestive stratification of artistic evidence.&#13;
The Museum documents the history of Sant’Eutizio Abbey, a splendid example of Romanesque architecture.&#13;
The collection includes works of art and handicraft connected with the life of the abbey and the people of the surrounding valleys, who through the centuries have seen it as a point of reference. &#13;
The four rooms on the first floor, along which the itinerary display stretches, are dedicated to the Treasure of the Abbey, the Abbott Crescenzi, the Surgical School of Preci, the Pharmacy and the Alchemical Laboratory.&#13;
The Treasure Room displays some of the pieces that have enriched the abbey during the course of the centuries, among which, apart from the wooden statue of St Eutizio attributed to Nicola da Siena; reliquaries, liturgical items, precious Silverware, refined embroideries and works in embossed leather stand out.&#13;
The room dedicated to Abbott Crescenzi, whose spiritual father was St Filippo Neri, follows. He had an important role for having commissioned the execution of the painting known as The Inspiration of Saint Matthew for the Contarelli Chapel in the Church of San Luigi dei Francesi in Rome, to Caravaggio. The third room is dedicated to the renowned Surgical School of Preci, which had its origins right in Sant’Eutizio.&#13;
In the last two rooms there is a reconstruction of an ancient pharmacy, with its old counter and medicines displayed together with the recipes of illustrious doctors. There is an ancient alchemical laboratory in the room with the monumental fireplace, which is furnished with its washbasin and ewers, alembics where potions were heated and a small grindstone to amalgamate the ingredients. Dangerous poisons and recipe books, which remain outside the reach of uninitiated people, are still visible inside the locked wall cabinet.&#13;
According to an 8th century hagiographic text, the Passio XII fratum, St Eutizio was one of the many hermits who came from the East and settled in the Apennines. The saint never had the gift of performing miracles during his life, but he was famous for being a thaumaturgist who could cure headaches, and being called upon to conjure the danger of drought."

4197,20525,traduzioni_descrizione,en,"Bufalini Castle&#13;
Castello Bufalini was originally built as a military fort and owned by the Dotti, a Ghibelline family from Sansepolcro. After the battle of Anghiari, in 1440, the small fort became a military outpost in defense of the territory of Città di Castello, and was destroyed towards the end of the 15th century as ordered by the Florentine Republic. With the passing of the property to Niccolò di Manno Bufalini in 1487, some reconstruction work based on the design of the Roman architect Mariano Savelli and indications of Giovanni and Camillo Vitelli, men of arms and experts in military construction, was carried out. The castle assumed the semblances of a fortress, with an irregular quadrangular floor plan and four towers at the corners, one of which—the Main Tower or Keep—was larger than the others and surrounded by a wide moat filled with water.&#13;
The history of the castle is indissolubly tied up with the Bufalini family, who could boast of having successful and prominent figures in the ecclesiastical, literary and juridical fields.&#13;
Starting from the 1530s, the fortress was transformed into a noble palace, responding to precise artistic, social and cultural needs, as desired by Giulio I Bufalini and his brother, the Abbot Ventura.&#13;
Even though it was mainly the interior to be subjected to major changes with the creation of large rooms distributed around an internal court with two side porticos, the remake of the façade with the introduction of the loggia and the monumental entrance in a central position dates back to that period. From the outside, the original military structure of the edifice looked the same. The design of the palace was the work of the Florentine architect, Giovanni d’Alesso, called Nanni Unghero, part of the Sangallo entourage, but the construction work was completed with the intervention of the Vignola, around 1560.&#13;
During the last decade of the 17th and the first years of the 18th century, the palace was restructured, following the designs of the architect-painter Giovanni Ventura Borghesi from Città di Castello, as a delightful countryside Villa with its Italian Garden. The edifice was enriched, during the 18th century, with exquisite works of art of late Baroque taste, among which are the frescoes, decorative canvases and painting cycles partially devoted to celebrating Bufalini’s acquisition of the noble title of Marquis.&#13;
In July 1989, Castello Bufalini became State property, and constitutes a rare example of an almost intact historical patrician manor that preserves most of its furniture and fittings that formed from the 16th to the 19th century, together with a collection of paintings coming from Bufalini Palace in Città di Castello.&#13;
Currently, the entire complex is organized—furniture and fittings, paintings, tapestry, majolica and the various busts of Ancient Rome—in line with the taste of the local nobility.&#13;
Along the itinerary of visit, visitors can admire:&#13;
The Room of the Pagan Gods and the Prometheus Room, with the frescoes of Cristofano Gherardi; The Loggia; The Sideboard Room, with the precious china cabinets preserving chinaware, ceramics and crystal sets; The Dining Room; The Lounge; The Room of the Throne, with the canvases portraying scenes from the Old Testament and the Orlando Furioso of the Ariosto; The Portraits Gallery; The Stucco Decorated Room; and The Room of the Cardinal Giovanni Ottavio Bufalini, with the beautiful cradle.&#13;
The garden is a typical example of an Italian Garden that still has the arrangement desired in the 18th century today. The Rose Garden, the Vegetal Gallery, called “voltabotte”—barrel vaulted—the so-called “Paradise” and the Labyrinth are especially beautiful."

The building that once was a tobacco warehouse is now the premises of the Museum. The edifice was built at the end of the 19th century by the Municipality of San Giustino. The structure was expanded in the following years and remained active until 1992, when the tobacco processing was transferred to the industrial area, inside the new warehouses.&#13;
The Museum is unique in its genre, the structure hosting it is of notable historical interest both for documenting tobacco cultivation and its manufacturing stages, and for the importance this has had on the economy of the territory.&#13;
At first entirely dedicated to tobacco processing, the Museum was founded by the Foundation for the Historic-Scientific Museum of Tobacco, constituted in 1997 by all participants, such as businesses and associations acting in the tobacco productive chain, from farmers to tobacco shops. The Museum, examined the legislation on the matter, and reconstructed the various processing stages distinguishing between three of them: the farming stage—growing and cultivation; the raw-material treatment stage—sorting of the leaves, selection of quality and treatment; the manufacturing stage—the actual production of the final products—sniffing tobacco, cigars and cigarettes.&#13;
The Foundation also benefits from the involvement of the municipalities of the High Tiber Valley, where the tobacco manufacture was imported for the first time in Italy, at the end of the 16th century, in the territory of the historical Republic of Cospaia, 1441-1826."

Villa Magherini Graziani—the Museo Archeologico della Villa di Plinio il Giovane housing complex—is a splendid example of Italian Noble Residence of the Late Renaissance period. The edifice is set half way up an open space on a panoramic hillside overlooking the Tiber Valley.&#13;
The construction of the Villa is due to Carlo Graziani, a prominent member of this family from Città di Castello and of Tuscan origins who commissioned, at the beginning of the 18th century, the architect Antonio Gallina to carry it out.&#13;
The 17 meter high Altana Tower dominates the architectonic complex and has a quadrangular floor plan that rises up for three floors. The elegant central Loggia develops on the main façade of the building, from the second floor up to the third, with its arcades standing on subtle columns in line with the Vasari style design of Castello Bufalini. The façade design follows a pattern of lesenes and frames that optically divide the space. The ground floor is decorated with a corbel-arched frieze under which windows and oval niches open, evoking the regular division of space of a Portico. A lateral entrance leads to a barrel-vaulted carriage passage that goes through the entire edifice. At the center of this gallery, the ground floor—along the main axis of the building—opens to the atrium and the reception room, while on the first floor it opens to the Loggia. On the left, the building is completed with the presence of the farmhouse, and on the right with the private chapel with a central nave, dedicated to the Madonna of Loreto.&#13;
The gardens are inside a pentagonal wall; along the central axis of the building on the front side there is the Italian garden with a central fountain and boxwood edges, while on the backside there is the exedra and a park of Holm oaks. Today the Villa is property of the Municipality. The farmhouse is the seat of the Foresteria, where socio-cultural activities are held, and is also the operational premise where authorities, the Superintendence of the Archaeological Excavation of Umbria, the University of Perugia and the University of Alicante (Spain) reside and manage the excavation campaign inside the Pliny the Younger Villa.&#13;

On the first floor there will be a tridimensional illustration, a plastic model of the excavation site, as well as a display of the items found and brought back to light. On the ground floor the environmental history of the High Tiber Valley will be documented, with particular attention to the ancient Roman field farming system of ‘centuriation’, of which the villa was one of the main cornerstones."

&#13;
The Museo Archeologico Statale di Spoleto is located in the former Monastery of Sant’Agata, in the historical city centre of Spoleto, in the southern block of houses formed by the crossing of the modern road of Via Monterone and Via Sant’Agata, where the ancient Roman Theater used to be.&#13;
The religious edifice, once a Monastery dedicated to St Agatha, was built at the end of the 14th century over the remnants of a Roman Theatre—dated 1st century B.C.—dramatically changing the scenic setting.&#13;
Inaugurated in 1985, the museum stretches over several floors, adapting its display to the architecture of the historical edifice. A new design of organic renovation of the old display has been foreseen; and a first section, of this new future setting, was already completed in 2008.&#13;
Through the archaeological finds that also come from more recent research, the early human presence where the Rocca—medieval fortress—stands and in the area of the town historical center—dating from the Bronze Age and from the period when the Umbrian settlement developed—is documented. This is especially testified by the rich funerary goods, dating from the 7th and 6th century B.C., found in the Piazza d’Armi Necropolis.&#13;
The items found in Valnerina, an area that has always had a close relationship with Spoleto, are exhibited on the second floor of the museum. The late Bronze Age cinerary urns found in the Necropolis of Monteleone di Spoleto, the finds from Montefranco Sanctuary, and the funerary goods from the Hellenistic and Roman Necropolis of Norcia are particularly worth being mentioned. Also many finds from the Canzio Sapori Collection, recently donated to the State, come from this same territory. It is worthwhile mentioning a cinerary clay-pugged urn decorated with a geometrical pattern coming from Ponte di Cerreto and a notable Late Republican male bust from Ferentillo.&#13;
In the section dedicated to the illustration of the Roman Theater, decorative sculptures found at the excavation site inside the monument—discovered during the 1950s— are exhibited. These include The Aura—personification of a soft breeze—reworked and presented as Venus, but recognized as a Greek original marble from the 5th century B.C. from recent studies. It was reworked in the Roman Ages to adapt it to the features of the goddess progenitor of the Julio-Claudia Gens. The interest of such a discovery is enhanced by the rarity of the original Greek statues, which are mainly known through the multiple copies made by the Romans.&#13;
The Theater, which is an integral part of the Museum Tour, dates back to the 1st century B.C. It was partially incorporated into the back edifices and underwent partial dismantling in the Middle Ages. Systematic interventions of restoration, starting in the 1950s, recovered the entire complex including the Cavea seating. In any case, the lower floor is well preserved, with the ambulatory still accessible. During the events connected with Spoleto’s Festival dei Due Mondi—Spoleto Festival—this theatre is used for the performances."

The Museo del Tessile e del Costume Antico is in the historical city center of Spoleto, housed in Palazzo Rosari Spada.&#13;
This palace, built in the 17th and 18th century, was the property of the ancient family from Spoleto that counted Virgilio Rosari—ordained cardinal in 1557 and fierce enemy of St Philip Neri—among its illustrious members.&#13;
In 1664, Rosari Palace became property of the Marquises Spada of Rome, and in the early years of the 19th century becomes property of the Marignoli family.&#13;
The rich caisson ceilings, framed-in wall plaster friezes, decorating the wide rooms of the halls on the first and second floors are what remain of the majestic interior fittings.&#13;
In the courtyard, it is possible to observe what remains of a terraced Roman wall.&#13;
This Museum is interesting for the rich textile collection hosted in one of the most important historical buildings of Spoleto, which once was the seat of the Civic Gallery.&#13;
The collection hosted mainly consists of textiles, clothing and embroidery and laces, dating from the 14th to the 20th century, while private donations and sound purchases have added to it since then.

&#13;
The Museo Diocesano is located in the historical center of Spoleto, near the Duomo of Santa Maria Assunta, in the same area as the Palazzo Arcivescovile.&#13;
In ancient times the area, today occupied by the Archbishop’s palace, was the residence of the Longobard Dukes.&#13;
A visit to the Diocesan Museum is suggested in order to admire the works coming from the many Spoleto-Norcia Diocese districts, which are reunited here to safeguard their artistic heritage, which is seriously endangered by inappropriate conservation measures, illegal alienations and theft.&#13;
Hosted in the Piano Nobile—Main Floor—of the building, in the wing called “The apartment of the Cardinal”, the large collection of works was born in 1976, and is recognized by art critics and scholars as one of the most interesting in Central Italy. The collection boasts remarkable paintings dating from the 12th to the 18th century, including works of artists such as The Master of the Strauss Madonna, Filippino Lippi, Domenico Beccafumi, Cavalier d’Arpino and Sebastiano Conca. &#13;
The sculpture collection, which presents a rich variety of styles and materials, is also outstanding: from the Romanesque Wooden Groups dating from the 13th century to the Renaissance Madonna and Child of the Master of the Madonna of Macereto, up to the bronzes portraying Urban VIII of Gian Lorenzo Bernini and St Philip Neri of Alessandro Algardi, real masterpieces of the Baroque period. Furthermore, there are collections of liturgical vestments and precious metal furnishing items.&#13;
Completing the Museum Tour there is the Sant’Eufemia Basilica, whose access is gained through the “Cardinal Chapel”, decorated with frescoes attributed to Andrea Sacchi, dating from the beginning of the 17th century. &#13;
Being one of the most notable Romanesque edifices in Umbria, the church—dating back to the first half of the 11th century—is part of that flourishing architectural stage in the territory of Spoleto that coincides with the maximum extension and power of the Diocese.&#13;
Among the most célèbre works preserved in the Museum is the bronze bust portraying Urban VIII of Gian Lorenzo Bernini, donated by the pope to the town of Spoleto in 1644, in memory not only of the years he lived there as its bishop—1608-1617—but above all in memory of the complete remodeling of the inside structure of the Duomo, ordered by him and his nephew, the Cardinal Francesco Barberini, who is also Patron of Spoleto."

&#13;
The Museo Nazionale del Ducato di Spoleto is located inside the Rocca, in the highest part of the historical center of Spoleto. The Museum was instituted to document the history of the Duchy, born thanks to the Longobards, a Germanic population who broke the political unity of the Italian peninsula in the 6th century A.D.&#13;
The Rocca was built by order of the Spanish Cardinal Gil Alvarez Carrillo de Albornoz starting in 1360, and was the center of the Episcopal and Papal See. Today, with the progressive recovery of the rooms and frescoes that still decorate the walls, the complex has finally recovered its early charm, after having been used as a detention centre for a long time.&#13;
The Museum proposes an interesting documentation of the knowledge of the Spoleto territory from the 4th to the 15th century, and at the same time illustrates, through various panels, the beauty of the frescoed rooms in which the works of art are displayed.&#13;
Inaugurated in 2007, the Museum was instituted thanks to the project of collecting the materials and works of art, in large part already held in the Civic Museum and the Art Gallery, which are useful in documenting the origins, development and the multiple historical and cultural relapses of the Longobard Duchy of Spoleto.&#13;
It is structured in two spaces around the Cortile d’Onore—the Ward of Honor—one on the Ground Floor and the other on the First Floor, and is subdivided into 15 rooms. &#13;
Overall the work collection covers an arch of time that spans from the 4th century A.D., with evidence of the early Christian communities, to the 15th century. Conceived as an appropriate tool for acquiring knowledge of the town and its territory, the museum intends to convey the complexity of the historical events in which it was involved, to the visitors, while at the same time showing its cultural vivacity, even after the fall of the Duchy.&#13;
The exhibition itinerary starts from the 4th century, by illustrating the early Christian communities through material coming from funerary sites and neighboring public buildings of cult, highlighting the phenomenon of monasticism. This is followed by the works from the 6th to the 9th century, which witnessed the artistic evolution of the territory, and finally ends with the sculptures and paintings from the 12th to the 15th century that document the extraordinary artistic flourishing of the town and its territory very well, such as the Santa Maria delle Grazie Triptych of Niccolò di Liberatore. Along the pathway, illustrative panels—giving account of the historical function of each room the visitors go through—complete the itinerary."

&#13;
The Museo Palazzo Collicola Arti Visive is located in the historical center of Spoleto, inside Palazzo Collicola, which occupies the entire western side of the homonymous square.&#13;
Palazzo Collicola was one of the most important patrician edifices of the town, built between 1717 and 1730 by the architect Romano Sebastiano Cipriani, and the residence of the noble Collicola family. After the extinction of this family, the palace was bought by the Municipality of Spoleto in 1939.&#13;
The Museum of Palazzo Collicola Arti Visive, together with the Collezione Burri, of Città di Castello, is the most important museum of contemporary art in the region. &#13;
A lively museum, an active pole of attraction for contemporary art, it hosts the legacy of the Art critic Giovanni Carandente and the works of the Spoleto Prize on the first floor, while the temporary exhibitions are hosted on the second floor.&#13;
The Library, part of the same donation, containing more than 20 thousand volumes of contemporary arts, is not to be missed.&#13;
The museum, inaugurated in 2000 and reorganized in 2010, occupies the rooms of the ground floor and those of the first floor. Three main sections are arranged in the 15 rooms of the ground floor. The Collection Carandente, which includes Italian and international artists of worldwide fame, is preserved there. The works of Alexander Calder, Henri Moore, Ettore Colla, Nino Franchina and Pietro Consagra are part of the collection. Another group of works executed by artists of the “Informal Naturalism” current were acquired through the Spoleto Prize (1953-1968).&#13;
A further section of the collection consists of donations from artists and art collectors along with purchases by the Municipality. Among these, the nucleus of works dedicated to the sculptor Leonardo Leoncillo from Spoleto stands out: there are sketches; sculptures; ceramics and majolica, which arrived at the museum starting in the 1980s.&#13;
Rooms dedicated to the temporary exhibitions are on the first floor.&#13;
In the summer of 1962, Spoleto was the protagonist of a legendary event, which had never happened before in the history of contemporary sculpture. The exhibition “Sculture nella città”—Sculptures in Town—was organized, by the initiative of Giovanni Carandente. The streets and squares of the historical center of Spoleto were filled with 104 sculptures realized by 54 of the greatest sculptors of the 20th century, among them Alexander Calder, author of the Teodelapio—the first stable monumental sculpture of the American artist is still in place in front of the Train Station today."

&#13;
The Rocca Albornoziana is located on the summit of Sant’Elia hill overlooking the historical Spoleto city center.&#13;
Built under the direction of the Spanish Cardinal Gil Alvarez Carrillo de Albornoz—around 1360—the fortress was a Papal Legate and Pope see. Today, with the progressive recovery of its rooms and frescoes that still ornate its walls, the complex has finally re-found its strategic collocation for control of the great Roman road Via Flaminia, that once was a fulcrum and ideal point of departure for military actions aimed at recovering the lost territories of Umbria, Marche and Emilia-Romagna. While the fortress constituted the pivotal center of the defensive system of the Papal State, it was conceived of as a residential home, first for the Governors of the Duchy, and after for Governors of the city and Papal Legates, and was therefore frescoed like the many refined patrician dwellings of the time.&#13;
The Rocca, whose construction started in 1359, was built by order of the Spanish Cardinal Gil Alvarez Carrillo de Albornoz with the aim of subjugating the town again, under the rule of the Papal State. The architect from Gubbio, Matteo di Giovannello, better known as Gattapone, was commissioned for the work. There are six towers, four at the corners and two median towers along the wall. Internally the main body of the edifice stands in-between two courts: the Ward of Arms to the south, and the Ward of Honor to the north. With the progressive salvaging of rooms and frescoes the complex has finally recovered its early charm. The Hall of Honor and the Camera Pinta—literally ‘painted room’, frescoed with a rare chivalrous cycle dating from the 15th century—are evidence of their old beauty.&#13;
By affirming them, successfully, as instruments for defense and maintaining peace in town, all strongholds like the Roccas were symbols of ruling powers. Their purpose was to guarantee the obedience and submission of the people to the institutions of the Church, and they became the most evident characteristic of the Church’s domination and conquests. This was the case with the Rocca of Spoleto and those of Narni, Orvieto, Assisi, Todi and Spello."

Analogous in dimension and shape—50 by 8 meters—they have a rectangular plan and are subdivided internally into twelve interconnected chambers. This work of hydraulic engineering that used to supply the hill with water constitutes a rich underground heritage of the town, which has a thick network of wells, galleries and cisterns of every age.

The Lucrezie Complex, located in the Nidola neighborhood, originated in the first half of the 15th century, when a noblewoman from Ancona’s Marches—old imperial administrative subdivision including the towns of Ancona, Camerino and Fermo—madonna Lucrezia della Genga endowed her sisters—in 1425—with an edifice along the wall of the town of Todi. The monastic seat, pertaining to the Franciscan Third Order, expanded rapidly in a few years with the acquisition of the adjacent buildings. However, the prosperity of the Monastery came to a halt before the economical crisis that occurred at the end of the 15th century, and degraded further after some landslides damaged the premises around 1760 and lastly with the Napoleonic laws of confiscations relating to the suppression of religious congregations in 1862. From the end of the First World War to 1987, the complex that had become Municipal property was used for disparate purposes, and in the context of the work of consolidation of the Cliff in Orvieto and the Hill in Todi, the entire structure was restructured by the effect of the law n. 545 of 1987.&#13;
The Lapidarium preserves stones from the ancient, medieval and modern age that belong to the municipality. They were found in town and in the surrounding areas and were moved around over the centuries to different locations, until 2008, when they were displayed in the current exhibit location.

The Museo Archeologico e Pinacoteca Comunale has its premises in Todi overlooking the eastern side of Piazza del Popolo, the political and religious heart of the town and one of the most beautiful squares in Italy. It is housed on the last floor of the two palaces, Palazzo del Podestà and Palazzo del Capitano del Popolo, which were once united—during the 17th century—by an overpass. Palazzo del Podestà, also called Communal Palace, had its construction started in 1213, based on a model taken from the typical design of Northern Italian Communal palaces. The construction of Palazzo del Capitano del Popolo started in 1293 and protracted until 1301.&#13;
The Civic Museum of Todi was instituted in 1871 and initially had its premises inside the Rooms of the Captain, today the Council Hall in Palazzo del Capitano. Reorganized and reopened to the public in 1997, the exhibition itinerary starts with a visit to the museum of the town, which includes objects illustrating the main events of the town history. Five typological sections follow.&#13;
In the first section—the archaeological one—there are Attic ceramics decorated with red and black shapes, domestic tools or female ornaments and votive bronzes, evidence of the close commercial ties between Todi and the nearby Volsinii—Orvieto.&#13;
The second section—the numismatic one—includes Pre-Roman, Greek, and Roman Republican and Imperial coins, followed by Ostrogoths, Byzantines, medieval and modern ones, for a total of 1475 samples, of which 130 pieces were coined by the Tuder Mint.&#13;
The textile section follows, where liturgical vestments and handmade items of various ages and provenance are exhibited. &#13;
The section dedicated to ceramics includes earthenware—prevalently of common use dating from the 8th to the 18th century—and is displayed in a splendid hall furnished with portraits of illustrious personalities of Todi, a fresco depicting the town and its territorial landscape by Pietro Paolo Sensini and a fresco depicting the legend of the Founding of Todi by Ignazio Mei.&#13;
In the Pinacoteca—the Art Gallery—apart from the majestic altarpiece of Giovanni di Pietro, called Lo Spagna, one of the most important disciples of the Perugino, depicting The Coronation of the Virgin, there are a number of canvases of the 17th century documenting the close relationship between the local figurative culture and that of Rome."

The Museo della Civiltà Contadina is located in Bodoglie Alte, a few kilometers from the historical center of Todi.&#13;
Open to visitors since 1987, the Museum of Bodoglie was instituted thanks to the initiative of Tersilio Foglietti, a former sharecropper and then entrepreneur in the furniture sector, who invested his experience as a farmer in a passionate three-year search for tools, utensils and machinery suited to represent the most typical rural civilization of the Umbria region.&#13;
The Museum occupies the space of a construction that was once a barn. The collections are arranged following a thematic subdivision reflecting the disposition of rooms of a typical rural house of peasants.&#13;
The display starts with the representation of the kitchen, which hosts the “Insaccatrice”—i.e. the staffing machine used to make sausages—the washbasin, the “madia”— i.e. the wooden cupboard used for kneading bread dough—and the “battilarda”— i.e. a wooden chopping board especially used to cut bacon to give more flavor to the food or to cut fat for making soap.&#13;
In the bedroom there is a bed, with its mattress full of cornhusks, the bed warmer called “prete”, and the baby walker called “girello”. Next to the latter, the room dedicated to the weaving and spinning activities hosts a precious wooden handloom that is perfectly preserved.&#13;
The largest room displays the utensils for working in the fields and the tools for the artisanal activities: the plough called ”voltaorecchio”—defined as such by popular imagination because it was able to cut furrows in the soil and turn them over, to the right or to the left as needed, with respect to the marching direction—the sifting tools and the mill stones to grind grains, not counting the tools of the “ciabattino”—i.e. the shoemaker—and that of the carpenter.&#13;
There are also exhibited a number of measures for agriculture like the sack, or the “staio”—a wood container to measure grains, olives and cereals—the cup, the tankard and the “foglietta” to measure processed products such as oil and flour.&#13;
In front of the building there are a number of farming tractors, among them a 1917 Ford and a 1918 Fiat testify the shift from a largely manual farming to a mechanized one."

This Palace, built in the 17th century, represents an important example of patrician-rural-estate. It was the summer residence of the Perugian Graziani family. Its name “Graziani-Baglioni” is due to the marriage—in the 19th century—of Anna Graziani and Pietro Baglioni.&#13;

The collection is subdivided into thematic sections, but all of them are centered on the main subject: wine. Here the visitor can admire rare and important archaeological finds like the wine amphorae, ewers and symposium cups, ceramics from the Early Middle Ages to contemporary times, engravings, winemaking tools and, unique in its genre, a collection of Waffle Irons.&#13;

Supported by the family enterprise and managed by Lungarotti Foundation, the museum retraces the history and the different uses of the Olive tree and Olive oil, without any geographical or temporal limits.&#13;
Archaeological finds, ceramics, books and other material describing the mythological origins of this plant, its production, diffusion and different uses are exhibited. Among them is the Attic alabastron—a particular vase for containing perfumed oils—decorated with a red pattern by the Painter of the Foundry, dated in the 5th century B.C. Ample space is dedicated to the collection of lamps, from the ancient pre-Roman ones to those of the 20th century. A section is dedicated in particular to: the Olive Tree and the Olive Oil Symbolism in graphic arts and handicraft; the display dedicated to Traditions and Folklore recalls ancient beliefs and popular superstitions."

&#13;
“Scultori a Brufa” is a Park of sculptures en plain air. It was conceived of in 1987, with the initiative of inviting one sculptor a year to exhibit their work along the roads around the vineyards and the small squares of the village of Brufa, and the buying of a work of art that was specially made for the municipality.&#13;
Brufa, whose hills are designed by the vineyards of the prestigious Torgianese wine production, dominates the Tiber River Plains towards Assisi and Foligno from the summit of the hill. The town is part of the “Wine and Art” road-itinerary—on the ridge of the hills— going through the towns of Torgiano-Brufa-Miralduolo-Torgiano, the so-called “Strada del Vino e dell’Arte”.&#13;
In this landscape, majestic sculptures of contemporary artists have been placed; works of artists such as Pierucci, Sforna, Pizzoni, Miniucchi, Giuman, De Felice, Liberatore, Caruso, Sguanci, Mastroianni, Carroli, Lorenzetti, Roca-Rey, Carrino, Giuliani, Marotta, Mattiacci, Staccioli, Trubbiani, Cascella, Magnoni, Brook and Corsucci, which were commissioned by the institutions of Brufa Pro Loco, Torgiano Municipality and the Province of Perugia to create attractive Art-spots for the visitors in the cultivation fields."

&#13;
The Raccolta d’Arte di San Francesco is hosted inside the former Convent of San Francesco, in the historical city center of Trevi. &#13;
The edifice was once the seat of a Franciscan convent, built around the 13th century, rebuilt and decorated in the first half of the 17th century, and again retouched during the 19th century.&#13;
It has been transformed into the Museum hosting the “Raccolta d’Arte San Francesco” and the “Museo della Civiltà dell’Ulivo” since 1997.&#13;
The Art Collection held in San Francesco deserves a careful visit, both for its beauty and for the beauty of the premises where it is collocated. In fact, the former Franciscan convent with its outdoor cloister, frescoed by Bernardino Gagliardi depicting the Stories from the Life of St Francis, hosts important works of the Umbrian school—from the 13th and 14th century—and paintings on canvases from some time between the 16th and 18th century, among which there is the famous altarpiece of the artist nicknamed Lo Spagna (1522). &#13;
Today, the San Francesco Art Collection is part of the Trevi Museum Circuit together with the Olive Tree Civilization Museum and Palazzo Lucarini, which is fostering knowledge of contemporary art with exhibitions and complementary public events. &#13;
The Museum exhibition is subdivided into two separate sections. The Archaeological section is displayed in three rooms on the ground floor. Recently set up in 2007, it collects Italic finds, finds of the Roman Age and funerary goods coming from the Longodard necropolis of the nearby locality of Pietrarossa.&#13;
The section dedicated to Trevi and its territory displaying materials documenting its development is on the same floor.&#13;
The Historical-Artistic section is held on the upper floors, and displays works of art coming from the 19th century post-Italian Unification requisitions of ecclesiastic assets. They are mostly paintings on wooden boards dating from the 14th century and important paintings on canvas executed between the 16th and the 18th century. Among these The Assumption of the Virgin of Alessandro Turchi, an artist from Verona who is better known as L’Orbetto, is of particular interest.&#13;
Among the works collected the processional Gonfalon depicting The Virgin of Mercy and Monogram—of a follower of Niccolò Alunno in the second half of the 15th century—and The Coronation of the Virgin—executed in 1522 by Giovanni di Pietro, called Lo Spagna, for the main altar of the Church of San Martino—stand out. There are numerous references to the provenance of the works exhibited, and first among all is the nearby Madonna delle Lacrime Sanctuary, property of the Municipality, which hosts frescoes of Spagna and Perugino."

“Historical and Archaeological Itinerary of the Trasimeno Battle”&#13;
Tuoro sul Trasimeno, as per many historians opinion, was the theater of the Battle of Trasimeno, the first of the serious defeats suffered by the Roman forces by the Carthaginian army, led by Hannibal Barca on 24 June 217 B.C.&#13;
This was the third victory accomplished by the Carthaginian leader in his campaign in Italy, after those of the rivers Ticinus and Trebia, before the massacre of Cannae.&#13;
To remember this historical event, the Municipality of Tuoro sul Trasimeno has organized an itinerary subdivided into 12 stops, all equipped with panels illustrating the various stages of the battle, the characteristics of the two armies and their military equipment. During the summer, the itinerary is also the place where commemorative theatrical representations that involve the visitors are performed. Palazzo della Capra, instead, is the seat of the Documentation Center, which responds to scientific and popularization needs. Inside there is a Conference Room, equipped for film projections, a specialized Library, the Room dedicated to the Second Punic War and the Battle of Trasimeno Lake and a small Archaeological Museum. The Center is periodically the seat for meetings, conferences, debates and presentations of publications and magazines on the topic."

In the school the daughters of the fishermen, residents of the island, learned the delicate work of producing crochet laces—so called “from Ireland”—that were then sold in Perugia and Rome, also to the Royal Family, thanks to the Guglielminis’ acquaintances.&#13;
Half a century later, the precious qualities of the lace manufacturing and the growing demand for laces, led some women to start a real and true entrepreneurial working activity by re-opening the old school of lacework, which has even gained international recognition."

The construction, composed of an imposing squared tower, more than 30 meters high, and three other large crenellate towers, was the object of important restoration work during the 1980s, which has allowed the recovery of its historical identity, and at the same time the complete exploitation of its rooms and spaces designated to host the Contemporary Art Exhibitions today.&#13;

In the 13th century, in the area—later occupied by Santa Croce—there was a small church dedicated to SS Peter and Paul that had already been used as an oratory for the Confraternity of the Disciples of the Disciplined of St Mary.&#13;
Inaugurated in 1998, the Museum of Santa Croce has the peculiar characteristic that almost all of the works preserved here are still on the same altars they were originally executed for. The work of the collection of major relevance is the Deposition from the Cross of Luca Signorelli. On the lateral altars there are canvases with religious paintings from between the 17th and 18th century and a wooden sculpture portraying St Rocco of Romano Alberti, called “Nero” from Sansepolcro, coming from the close by Church of San Francesco. In an internal room on the first floor, there is the Madonna and Child in Glory, between Angels and Saints of Niccolò Circignani, called “il Pomarancio”, also coming from the close by Church of San Francesco.&#13;
The former Church of Santa Croce is also used for recording Classical Music, an activity in which many renowned international singers and directors participate in. It is also a stage for prestigious concert reviews."

&#13;
The Museo del Ricamo e del Tessile is located in Valtopina, on the ground floor of the Municipal building, an exclusive early 20th century palace.&#13;
The collection has about four hundred pieces subdivided into three sections: Ladies’ fashion, Lingerie, Household Linen. It illustrates the fundamental changes and simplifications Fashion went through at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century.&#13;
The inauguration of the Embroidery and Textile Museum, launched in 2007, was made possible thanks to a number of donations that were given starting in 2000, which regrouped manufactures belonging to historical families of Foligno, Spello and Perugia at first, and then this extended to other regions like Tuscany and Liguria. An important element that contributed to the birth of the collection was the presence of the School of Embroidery in Valtopina. Fostered by the Pro Loco institution, it contributes to keeping the traditions of minor arts alive, a kind of activity that is very important in small built-up areas of Umbria. The Museum collection is subdivided into three sections, Ladies’ fashion, Lingerie and Household Linen, which display about four hundred pieces.&#13;
The first section highlighting Ladies’ fashion, shows the simplification Fashion underwent at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century through its precious ladies’ clothes.&#13;
The second section, dedicated to Lingerie, highlights how this product has had new and refined solutions that enrich petticoats, corsets and camisoles, blouses and night-gowns, night caps, long johns, stockings and handkerchiefs with a profusion of embroidery and laces and white on white or pastel colored embroidery, between the 19th and the 20th century. A particular attention is reserved for newborn baby sets and baptismal ceremony sets. &#13;
Finally, the third section, dedicated to Household Linen highlights how young women collected their “imparaticci”—embroidery practice samples—with which they learned the technique, from when they went to boarding school.&#13;
The exhibition of the linen makes it clear that, notwithstanding the introduction of colored sheets during the Second Empire, the trousseau would still remain tied to embroidery and white textiles for a long time. Decorative patterns are in prevalence floral—symbolizing happiness and love—and bows or “knots of love” as well."

Standing on a hill on the left of the Tiber River, between Orvieto and Amelia, the Castello D’Alviano houses the museums. This Castle was at the origins of the urban nucleus of Alviano Municipality. It was built in the 10th century, and rebuilt in 1490 by Bartolomeo D’Alviano, a Captain of Fortune, who served the Papal State and the Republic of Venice as a mercenary and was a major figure of his lineage, who made Alviano the capital of a powerful, autonomous fief. &#13;

Another section of this museum—the Museo della Civiltà Contadina—is dedicated to documenting the Rural Culture through the tools and objects of everyday use in the life of a farmer, belongings of local families between the end of the 19th century and the aftermath of the Second World War that are connected with the production of wine and oil and the processing of hemp and wheat as well. &#13;

Organized following a thematic progression, inside the three floors of the complex, the display is the fruit of an integral reorganization of the historical-artistic archaeological material of the area.&#13;

The Centro di Paleontologia Vegetale was realized at the end of the 1990s to support the study activities of Dunarobba Fossil Forest, reconstructing its geological, climatic and Fauna characteristics through the finds,&#13;
illustrative panels and scale models.&#13;
The Fossil Forest was discovered at the end of the 1970s, inside a clay pit for the production of construction bricks. About fifty trunks, remnants of gigantic conifers that are currently visible, constitute an exceptional and rare evidence of some of the Flora species that characterized this area of the Italian peninsula in the arch of time spanning between 3 and 2 million years ago, i.e. in the geological era known as Pliocene. In large part still covered by sediment, this ancient forest indicates environmental conditions that are&#13;
fundamentally different from that of present days, also characterized by a sensibly warmer climate.&#13;
The conservation of the trunks in their original position during life and the almost complete preservation of the characteristics of the original wood are reasonably ascribable to a gradual and then permanent burialstatus, which happened in a swampy area on the banks of a vast lake. Furthermore, the area underwent a gradual collapse, i.e. a geological phenomena known as S ubsidence.&#13;
It is the peculiarity of this paleontological site that makes it a naturalistic monument, which is unique in the world and of great scientific relevance. During the years since the discovery, the Superintendence for the&#13;
Archaeological Heritage of Umbria has started a long lasting work of documentation for studying,&#13;
safeguarding and conserving this paleontological site.&#13;

It was opened in 2002, and is hosted by the Monastic Complex of the Nuns of the Ursuline Order. The structure, an outstanding example of Italian architecture of the 18th century, is the result of the incorporation of two churches with the 16th century main building of Palazzo Ferrini, joined together by a monumental façade designed by Ferdinando Fuga around 1739. This famous architect is also credited with the portion of the building constructed purposely for monastery use. &#13;
The displayed collection consists of works that can be dated approximately between the 16th and the 18th centuries and come from the monastery and the requisitions made in the 19th century by the then newly born Italian State, right after the unification of the nation. In the collection, an expert eye can grasp a glimpse of the artistic influence from the nearby regions, particularly from Rome and The Abruzzi, due to the particular geographical position of Calvi, which is right at the border of Umbria with Lazio and The Abruzzi. The historical halls and rooms of the Monastery are also open to visitors, as are the kitchens, the washhouse, the pharmacy, the cemetery area, the crypt, the vegetable garden and the gardens.&#13;

The Museo “Le Mummie di Ferentillo” is hosted inside the crypt of the Church of Santo Stefano, right in the city center of Ferentillo.&#13;
The church was built in the 15th century on top of another pre-existing religious building becoming the crypt. The very simple façade is characterized by a central rose window decorated with small sculptures, below which stands the white stone entrance portal, sided by two orders of lesene, showing the Coat of Arms of Lorenzo Cybo and of the Lateran Chapter at the base of the pilasters.&#13;
The inner part of the church has a three-nave structure, and in the apse, which is circular and in Baroque style, two small loggias open with their Rococo wooden balustrade. A large canvas depicting St Stephan Martyrdom, work of the painter Giuseppe Rosi (1759), is at the center. It is worth mentioning the fresco of Pierino Cesarei, dated 1595, depicting the Nativity and the splendid baptismal font. A tabernacle—to preserve the consecrated oils—dating from the 16th century is set on the presbytery, on the pillar to the right. Some mummies are preserved in the Romanesque crypt. They were discovered in 1805, when an edict from Napoleon ordered the exhumation of the corpses contained in churches. Twenty mummified bodies are held visible inside the shrines; the oldest one dates from about four centuries ago, while the most recent one is from the 19th century. The conservation of the corps is due to some peculiar microorganisms present in the&#13;
soil and the constant ventilation of the place."

The Antiquarium represents an opportunity to know aspects of the daily life and organization of the work that reemerged from the sumptuous Villa del Poggio Gramignano, inhabited by wealthy Roman citizens. The Antiquarium displays the materials recovered from the excavation in the Roman Villa site, erected in the second half of the 1st century B.C., near the Tiber River, in the valley right below the medieval burgh. Next to the introductory display cabinets—illustrating the geology of the site and the characteristics of the building materials employed in the construction of the Villa—there are the finds that emerged from the residential sector, which are richly decorated with mosaics and polychrome frescoes. As came to light after archaeological investigation carried out between 1988 and 1992, the Villa was abandoned in the 2nd century A.C., and some of its rooms were reused as a cemetery during the course of the 5th century.&#13;
The visit to the Civic Collection can be enriched by adding on a visit to the main palace and church of Lugnano, Palazzo del Pennone and the Collegiata of Santa Maria Assunta, built in the 12th century right in the center of the burgh."

Opened for the first time in 1985 as a temporary exhibition, the Mostra Permanente di Arnesi e Strumenti della Civiltà Contadina, Museum of Castel dell’Aquila has been hosted in some rooms in the High School of the village since 1988.&#13;
The collection is the result of the work of the members of the Circolo Culturale “Don Vincenzo Luchetti”, who collected the tools from the families of the place. There are 3500 well-documented items in the museum today.&#13;
The large room hosting the museum is subdivided in the typical spaces of a sharecropping farmhouse: the kitchen-living room, with its fireplace and the sideboard; the bedroom, with the bed warmer and the items for children, such as the baby walker, “camminarello”, the table for changing diapers, “fasciatoio” and the rudimental playpen or “guardiolo”. There is also the room of the traditional handmade works of women, where the tools women used for embroidery, for spinning hemp and wool fibers are displayed. The women were often assisted by children, who wound up the hank and skeins of yarns with the “naspo”. The room dedicated to the traditional artisanal work that men used to do includes the “gigliara” used to sift out the seeds, it was hung on the ceiling and twirled around. The room of the shoemaker, or “ciabattino”, displays the tools and the instruments used to work in the fields.&#13;
The thematic axis around which the display is arranged is that of the “penny pinching” culture of recycling. The meager rural economy, in fact, imposed the optimization of resources and consequently the reuse of every object possible, often reconverted for purposes different from the original: from the medicine bottles, useful if recycled as small candle holders or lamps; to the broken plates, restored with a hand made tool called the “appuntapiatti”, a rudimental sort of drill allowing the making of small holes to crimp and re-put the pieces together; to the caldron reused as a funnel; and the barbecue grill, which had a compartment to contain the meat fat, to be reused in the kitchen as shortening and in the laundry for soap making."

The Antiquarium Comunale is located in the small medieval burgh of Tenaglie, a locality in the municipality of Montecchio, in the province of Terni.&#13;
The visit to the Antiquarium represents an opportunity for the visitor to get acquainted with the culture and customs emerging from the vast Necropolis of Fosso di San Lorenzo through the exhibited objects.

Today this is a protected area called Parco Fluviale del Tevere, and is a natural park of considerable naturalistic interest.&#13;
The Museum exhibits some finds of funerary goods from the Umbrian-Etruscan necropolis, in particular from the two tombs found intact and attributed respectively to adults and children. Apart from the most common furnishings, there are also the ornamental items of every day use connoting the gender and social status of the deceased possessor such as: metal hairpins and gold and silver spiraling rings to hold hair, jewels, ointment boxes and make up for women; iron spearheads and other personal metal military equipment accompanying men. The necropolis, discovered in the 19th century and methodically investigated during the course of the 1970s, was attended from the 7th to the 4th century B.C."

inside the Parco Fluviale del Tevere, the natural park on the Tiber River, which extends along the slopes descending towards the stream of San Lorenzo, a tributary of the river.&#13;
This is one of the most extensive Pre-Roman necropolises ever discovered in Umbria up until now, testifying the existence of a flourishing center—not yet identified—in the immediate vicinity of the Tiber River. The visit to the necropolis and to this portion of the Nature Reserve is rendered easy by the presence of a signed pathway—with parking areas available—guiding the visitors to the site. The investigations have brought a number of tombs excavated in the rock to light, usually consisting of a sole squared room, to which a short “dromos”—corridor—provides access. The inner space was endowed with benches, where the funerary goods and the body of the deceased were arranged, following a more or less standard ritual consisting of piling-up the bones and objects in the corners to allow for new burials. The finds pertaining to the ancient&#13;
period—7th century B.C.—reveal the presence of a population sensibly influenced by the hegemonic site of the Etruscan Orvieto. In those pertaining to the most recent period—4th century B.C.—a progressive impoverishment that led to the definitive abandonment of the necropolis is documented. Several materials are exhibited in the Civic Antiquarium in the nearby locality of Tenaglie.

&#13;
The Convento della Scarzuola e Città Buzziana complex is located in Montegiove, a locality in the&#13;
municipality of Montegabbione.&#13;
Tradition has it that its name comes from a thatched hut, which St Francis built himself during one of his peregrinations. A church and a Franciscan convent were built, by order of the noble Nerio di Bulgaruccio of the Counts of Montegiove, in this very-same place in 1282. In the apse, of the Santissima Annunziata Church, there is a fresco dating from the first half of the 13th century, depicting St Francis in Mystical Levitation. It is one of the early paintings depicting the Saint, and isn’t yet part of the canons of the official iconography.&#13;
The convent, abandoned by the Franciscan Friars in the 18th century, was repossessed by Marquises Misciatelli of Orvieto, and remained his property until 1956, when it was acquired by one of the most renowned Italian architects of the 20th century, Tommaso Buzzi (1900-1981) from Milan. In twenty years hebbuilt his own “cittadella”—ideal town—centered around seven theaters, which was inspired by thenHumanistic ideals of the harmonic composition of Nature and Culture.&#13;
There are constructions of high symbolic value—even in their names: The Babel Tower, The Musical Scalenof the Seven Octave, Jacob’s Ladder, etc. etc.—running along the visit pathway. The climax is reached with the representation of the Acropolis, a mountain of Buildings, which are empty inside and often overlapping.&#13;

The Museo Eroli is located in the historical center of Narni, in the Terziere di Fraporta—one of its three medieval neighborhoods—next to the Church of San Francesco and behind the 14th century Palazzo del Podestà. It is easy to reach from the Parcheggio del Suffragio—the car parking—contiguous to the walls of the town, and connected to the historical center by some elevators.&#13;
Palazzo Eroli, as it looks today, was built as a noble residence of the local Eroli family, who—probably between the 17th and 18th centuries—grouping together various adjacent estates later joined together by a façade in common, transformed the agglomerate into their “Palace” in town.&#13;
The museum display is distributed over three floors. The First Floor is dedicated to the Prehistoric era in the local territory. From the evidence—animal fossils and utensils—collected and found in the territory, the exhibition reveals the ancient Roman Narnia and—always through the archeological findings—the visitor is guided to the medieval period of the town. This section goes into the life of the illustrious Captain of Fortune, Erasmo da Narni, known as Gattamelata. Video projections on plasma maxi screens, evocative music and panels that intend to arose emotions in the visitor—projecting him back into the history of this territory—accompany him towards the Gallery, where it is possible to admire, among other things, the altarpiece of The Coronation of the Virgin of Domenico Ghirlandaio and The Annunciation of Benozzo Gozzoli, both commissioned by Cardinal Berardo Eroli, highest example of patronage in Narni in the 15th century. In the display, there are works of art accompanied by innovative didactic aids, mostly of local artists, which show the visitor the evolution of the art in Narni from the 14th to the 18th century.&#13;
A room is dedicated to displaying the works; part of the collection was donated, during the 1930s, to the Municipality of Narni by the collector Edoardo Martinori, which includes an Egyptian wooden sarcophagus and an Egyptian Mummy, decorated with a rich and fine cartonnage.&#13;
In the 2700 square meters of Palazzo Eroli, apart from the exhibition area of the museum, various cultural events are also hosted. There is a bookstore with a didactic and recreational area for young people, and a cafeteria with a panoramic view on the Nera River Valley."

The Narni Sotterranea, consisting of some basement rooms located under the historical city center of Narni, extends from Via San Bernardo, inside the former Church of San Michele Arcangelo, to some rooms under the former Convent of San Domenico.&#13;
The discovery of these underground rooms, in 1979, was fortuitous. Several of these rooms were brought to light and restored in the following years. These include a Pre-Romanesque church, excavated in the rock and dated from the 12th – 13th centuries, containing a painting cycle of just a little later period depicting— among other paintings—St Michael Archangel, to whom the religious edifice is dedicated. It is also possible to visit the Courtroom of the ecclesiastical tribunal of the Inquisition, where the instruments of torture of the time and the cell where the condemned prisoners were locked up, which still conserve the touching traces of the prisoners’ presence in the room, are exhibited for demonstrative purposes. The journey to discover Narni’s underground can be integrated with a visit to the Church of Santa Maria Impensole under which—in the crypt—there are two Roman water Cisterns and a Lacus—another large cistern—of the Early Middle Ages. These are placed right below the public fountain of Piazza Garibaldi, which in ancient times was called “Lake”. Furthermore, it is possible to visit the Roman Aqueduct della Formina."

The mighty and austere Rocca Albornoziana stands on the highest slope above Narni, looking toward the historical center below, the tight canyon dug by the Nera River and Via Flaminia. It is reachable either by walking Via del Monte, or by taking the road in the direction of Via Flaminia, and then turning to the left on Via Feronia. This significant example of 14th century military architecture is still well preserved. It was built between 1360 and 1370 by order of Cardinal Gil Alvarez Carrillo de Albornoz and designed by architects of fame, such as Ugolino da Montemarte and Matteo Gattapone. Its floor plan is squared, with four towers of which the tallest is the Keep. The two Gothic style portals are decorative elements, like the four Coat of Arms sculpted above the access door. Inside, there are fragmentized frescoes, including a Madonna and Child—dating from the 15th century—of Umbrian school and the Coat of Arms of Pope Urban IV.&#13;
Cardinal Gil Alvarez Carrillo de Albornoz (Cuenca, 1299-Viterbo 1367), Papal Vicar and Legate, operated to restore and strengthen the papal authority and power all over the Papal State. He built castles and strongholds like the Rocca everywhere—often designing them himself—as a symbol of the power of the Church. The Rocca Maggiore and the Rocca Minore of Assisi, the Rocca of Spoleto, the Rocca of Todi and the Rocca of Orvieto are of the same period."

&#13;
The Museo Claudio Faina and the Museo Civico Archeologico are hosted inside Palazzo Faina, located in Piazza Duomo, in Orvieto.&#13;
The place was built in the mid 1800s over the old structure of the house of the Monaldeschi, a 13th century family that was among the wealthiest in Orvieto. In the 19th century Count Claudio Faina Senior acquired the palace, and moved his private family art collection—previously kept in his residence of Perugia—there. The building became the seat of the Museum in 1954, when Claudio Junior, the last heir, left all his properties to Orvieto Municipality to finance the Claudio Faina Museum Foundation in his will, and it has remained there ever since.&#13;
The exhibition arrangement aims at illustrating the steps of the gathering of the collection, from the&#13;
constitution of the original nucleus starting in 1864, by Count Mario, collected following the indications required by collectors of the time, up to its enrichment by Eugenio, Mario’s heir, who limited the acquisition of the finds to the Orvieto area, and promoted the formation of a Civic Museum rather than enriching the family collection.&#13;
From the gallery, located on the second floor of the palace, it is possible to admire a view of the Duomo from a particular perspective. The access to the Civic Archaeological Museum is in Piazza Duomo. It is housed on the ground floor of the palace and is entirely dedicated to the finds coming from the local excavation sites of Orvieto and its territory, which testify to the exceptional flourishing of Volsinii—the Etruscan town of Orvieto.&#13;
The architectural terracotta finds exhibited from the Belvedere area come from production of the finest artistic quality, executed in the course of the 5th century B.C. by Volsinii’s workshops. They are inspired by Classical Ancient Greek Art, and are what is left of the decorative apparatus and marble coated buildings of worship.&#13;
From the sacred area of Cannicella—its name comes from reeds, a perennial grass growing profusely in the area—a sanctuary identified inside the necropolis located to the south of the town, comes the célèbre sculpture of Venus, and from the Crocefisso del Tufo—The Tuff ’s Cross—necropolis located to the north, some funerary slabs with the inscription of the deceased and stones—cippi—are exhibited.&#13;
From the territory of Orvieto, some materials collected in the course of the 19th century are illustrated. Among these, the Torre di San Severo Sarcophagus, with its sculpted scenes depicting mediated episodes of the Greek Mythology of funerary inspiration, stands out.&#13;
The Claudio Faina Collection is arranged on the first floor—the Piano Nobile—and on the second floor of the palace, in a renewed arrangement set up in 1996. On the Piano Nobile, which preserves the 19th century decorations, the finds recovered by Faina are arranged highlighting especially the collecting activity of Mauro, in particular his numismatic collection, consisting of coins mainly from the Roman, Republican and Imperial periods. They are displayed in rigorous chronological order.&#13;
On the second floor, the finds are arranged following a typological and chronological order: from the Pre-&#13;
Prehistoric materials to the Attic ceramics, while some rooms are entirely dedicated to Etruscan ceramics."

Departing from the fulcrum, the Cathedral, the visit itinerary goes through the MODO nodes, following the main theme, the history of the town and its Duomo.

The Museo delle Maioliche Medievali e Rinascimentali Orvietane is housed in the edifice of an ancient kiln—a special furnace for the production of ceramics—in Orvieto. The permanent exhibition displays a collection that mainly consists of waste products from two kilns that were active in Via della Cava, from the second half of the 14th century to the mid 16th century. The collection was enriched by the acquisition of majolica from later periods, which the same furnaces worked on.&#13;
The collection has many pieces and the continuity of the production of the ceramists in Orvieto makes it extraordinary. Up until the first half of the 14th century, the town of Orvieto was considered to be a center for importing majolica; this product was essentially thought of as being imported.&#13;
However, much Renaissance Majolica exhibited in museums in Italy and other countries are attributed to majolica production centers such as Deruta, Faenza, Montelupo and Gubbio, to count some of the more famous. In fact, they share iconographical referrals—family armorial or corporations’ bearings—typical of the Orvieto area of production. This fact alone should have been enough to prove their provenance from the laboratories of Orvieto, but some cultural stereotypes, oriented to or dictated by the antique market, prevented an unbiased attribution of provenance. Today, the notion that not only one, but several production centers offered the same product is commonly accepted, underlining more than anything else its excellence. If it is undisputed that the production from Orvieto reached its highest levels in the 14th century, there is the tendency to affirm that it was then overtaken in the 15th and 16th century by Faenza and Deruta. But, a close and attentive examination of the majolica of this collection—above all to the kiln production waste—makes it clear that the quality remained very high.&#13;
The Museum makes ten rooms available for the display, starting with the Conference Hall, where once, in medieval times and during the Renaissance, majolica was processed for decoration painting and prepared for firing inside the kilns. In the so-called Sala della Cisterna—cistern room—it is still possible to see the actual cistern in which the water for the production of ceramics was kept. From there, the same water, through a channel excavated into the rocks and probably through a pipe, reached the places where raw clay was molded—tornitura—into shape. In the Sala della Fornace—the kiln room—it is possible to visit an almost intact and truly original ceramic kiln. In fact this is the only 15th century kiln that still exists in the entire World. In the Sala del Trecento—the room dedicated to the 1300s—the ceramics displayed, almost all-waste production remains, are the kind that have been considered to be a typical production from Orvieto. In the Sala dei Simboli—symbols room—there are the most important pieces of the collection. In the Sala delle Truffette—the room of the globular ewers—it is possible to see how some typologies of majolica were produced almost in series, which shows us that more than being an artisan workshop, the furnace was a real and true ceramic factory. Apart from the common stains—boccali—there are the globular ewers called truffette. In the Sala delle Zaffere—the room of the blue painted ceramics—there is evidence of all possible kinds of blue painted ceramics, called zaffere: from the classical to the diluted ones, ending with the so called damaschine and the imitations of oriental manufactured porcelain. In the Sala delle Ciotole—room of the bowls—in a part of the bowls it is possible to find very particular majolica. In the Sala del Rinascimento—Renaissance room—there are mostly many manufactured items coming from this furnace that, even if found in the Orvietans wells—excavated to throw away domestic waste—were attributed to artisan workshops of other towns. Typologies from Viterbo or from the northern area of the Lazio region, from Deruta, Faenza and Tuscany—or from other less probable provenances, such as the graffiti over the glazed slip casting, or ingobbio, the kind produced in Ferrara or in Veneto—are distinguishable. In the Sala delle Tazzine—room of the teacups—with its more than four hundred teacups, there is the evidence of ceramic production of an industrial character from the Via della Cava furnace."

The finds are arranged following the modern topographical museum criteria. The finds recovered from recent excavations—or on-going excavation—are displayed following a rotating plan, which allows the visitor to appreciate the constant achievement of new finds."

&#13;
The peculiar geological nature of massive stone, on which the town of Orvieto stands, has allowed its inhabitants to excavate, in the course of 2500 years, an incredible number of grotto like caves, extending, overlapping and intersecting each other under the modern urban structure. Today, these are a precious source of historical and archaeological data.&#13;
From the central Piazza Duomo, in front of the Cathedral, next to the Tourist Information Office, scheduled Guided Visits depart for the Città Sotterranea everyday. The visit in itself lasts one hour, and goes inside one of the most interesting and structured underground complexes of the town. Qualified personnel accompany the visitors, who discover the traces left by the ancient inhabitants of Orvieto, in a pathway that is easy and enjoyable. Here the effect of daylight and shadows cutting through the millenary obscurity of the subsoil&#13;
unveils deep and narrow wells, along which the Etruscans followed the underground water-bearing stratum in search of water, majestic stone mills and a long series of tunnels."

The complex, called Pozzo della Cava, has its entrance in Via della Cava, and winds under the ancient quarter of Orvieto.&#13;
There are nine subterranean caves, rich with Etruscan, medieval and Renaissance finds, which have been brought to light only recently, after almost four centuries of abandonment.&#13;
The deep well, from which the entire site takes its name, was excavated, readapting a pre-existing Etruscan well, by order of Pope Clement VII, who—seeking refuge in Orvieto, in 1527—ordered its realization to draw spring water in case of a siege. Its structure consists of two parts merged together: one has a circular crosssection, the other—which is smaller and dates from the 5th – 6th century B.C.—is rectangular. Next to the well, it is possible to continue ahead on the path and visit an Etruscan cistern, some butti—shafts used as dumping holes—a medieval wine cellar and remnants of ancient rupestrian tombs. The caves, used during medieval times and the Renaissance to produce ceramics, are also interesting. During Christmas Season, a&#13;
crèche is realized inside the complex, in the caves of the well. Its arrangement is different every year and always noteworthy for its artistic execution and historical setting."

&#13;
The Pozzo di San Patrizio is located in a panoramic position, in the city center of Orvieto. It was built under Pope Clement VII, during the sacking of Rome, in 1527, when the Pope found refuge in Orvieto. He commissioned this work to the Florentine architect Antonio da Sangallo the Younger. The execution of the work ended in 1537. The well has a circular cross-section, is 62 meters deep and 13 meters wide. Two spiral staircases are designed around the shaft to run separately—one above the other—avoiding any intersection between the two. Each ramp counts two hundred and forty-eight very comfortable steps, easy to walk downward even for packhorses or mule-drawn carts. At the base of the shaft, a small bridge connects the two staircases.&#13;
The emerging external part of the well consists of a large and low cylindrical construction. The outer decorations are part of the Arms of Pope Paul III—the Farnese family’s sculpted Lilies—who succeeded Pope Clement VII. At the entrance door, a plaque warns “quod natura munimento inviderat industria adiecit”—what nature stinted for provision, man’s application has supplied—paying honor to the power of human ingeniousness, capable of compensating for what Nature lacks, in this case lack of water in town."

&#13;
The Tower is located in the city center of Orvieto, along the main road of the town commonly called “corso”. At the end of the 13th century, Orvieto underwent a drastic change in its urban structure and saw the collocation of Palazzo dei Sette, together with the tower—47 meters high, known at the time as the Tower of the Pope, almost perfectly aligned with the four cardinal points—moved to a more strategical and central position. The imposing height of the towering building allowed, in fact, a dominating view of the then vast territory under the state administration of Orvieto. In the 16th century, the tower acquired the name of its owner, Raffaele (Gualtiero) di Sante, called Il Moro, who also gave his name to Palazzo Gualtiero, the building beneath, and to the entire city district. In 1865, a water tank—conceived of as part of the new aqueduct—was placed at the height of 18 meters inside the tower, and after some work of restoration carried&#13;
out in 1866, a mechanical clock and two civic bells were installed.&#13;
The smallest bell came from another tower, the Torre di Sant’Andrea, and the largest one from Palazzo del Popolo.&#13;
Both Palazzo dei Sette and Torre del Moro, recently restored and transformed into a cultural center, belonged to the ancient Della Terza family. It then passed to the Papal State, and hosted the seat of the seven magistrates of the town guilds and the Pope, and it seems that even the architect Antonio da Sangallo lived there."

The Antiquarium Comunale has its premises inside the 18th century Palazzo Priorale of Otricoli, a Pre-Roman village, built on a height dominating the Tiber River Valley in southern Umbria.&#13;
The exhibition itinerary illustrates the dynamics of the settlement around Otricoli, in its transformation from a Pre-Roman village on high ground to a Roman town built on the Tiber Valley, up to the current town built on the same place as the former village. Particular attention is paid to the archaeological collection that serves as an introduction to the visit to the Archaeological Park of the Roman Town of Ocriculum, which was one of the wealthiest and most vital centers thanks to the trading that took place along the Flaminian Way and the Tiber River between the 1st century B.C. and the 1st century A.D.&#13;
In the Civic Antiquarium, inaugurated in 2000, the exhibition related to the most conspicuous collection—the Roman one—makes use of casts and photographic reproductions of the original finds, which were transferred—as soon they were found in the 18th century Papal excavation sites—via river to the Vatican Museums, where they are still now preserved.&#13;
Above all Otricoli’s wealth and vitality is testified by the 58 centimeter high marble bust, which is what remains of a colossal statue most likely portraying the Jupiter of the local Capitol, the temple dedicated to the divine Capitoline Triad of Gods formed by Jupiter, Juno and Minerva. It was a copy of the statue of Jupiter of the Capitoline Hill, in Rome. But this wealth and vitality is also testified by the Thermal Polychrome Mosaic dated from the 2nd century A.D. that decorated the main octagonal hall.&#13;
The didactic itinerary ends with a section dedicated to the Otricoli built-up area of the Middle Ages and to modern Otricoli, whose architectural development has seen the use and re-use of a number of ancient materials."

The Museo Laboratorio dell’Appennino Umbro “Sotto-Sopra” is located in the city center of Polino, inside the fortress.&#13;
The small medieval burgh, located in the southern part of Umbria, stands majestically between Monte Petano and Monte Pelosa at the border with Rieti province. &#13;
The Rocca di Polino fortress was built, in the 12th century, by the Polini family. Of the original defensive system made of a double wall there remains only a polygonal structure enriched by two groups of cylindrically shaped and diametrically opposed towers.&#13;
The Museum-Laboratory offers the opportunity to better understand the evolutionary history of the Umbrian Apennines through scale models and other multimedia systems.&#13;
It is advisable to extend the visit to the small medieval village and the surrounding country: by going outside the village it is possible to admire the vast panorama to the south-east, towards Greccio, the lake of Piediluco, Rieti and Leonessa, to the north-east towards Monteleone of Spoleto, and to the north towards the Salto del Ciedo with the magnificent mountains of Monte Aspra and Monte Coscerno. It is possible to see almost the entire Valnerina with a glance.&#13;
The visit to the Museum-Laboratory in Polino is a journey to discover what is meant by “Below” ground—in Italian Sotto—i.e. the geologic conformation of the territory, and what is meant by “Above” ground—in Italian Sopra—i.e. the flora and fauna and the Umbrian Apennines landscape. This journey is also reflected in the Museum display, whose two floors host respectively the themes connected to Geology/Paleontology and to Natural Sciences.&#13;
Instead, a series of themes related to the above—but that also possess their own autonomy—are housed on the first floor of Palazzo Castelli, where together with the reception and the bookshop, a huge aerial picture of the area and its scale model—a topographical plan—indicating the levels of the contour, visitors can orient themselves and immediately get to know the structure of what is a real and true Scientific Park.&#13;
This palace also houses the Didactic Laboratory for the Study and Classification of Ammonites.&#13;
At a short distance from the burgh of Polino, a little stone quarry extends the museum experience with a practical activity. The museum was recently expanded and an info-point—called “A Window on the Nera River”—has been opened.&#13;
With the assistance of specialized personnel, visitors are trained to look for and extract fossil ammonites from the rock, which are later separated from their rock-matrix by using instruments that are analogous to the ones used by paleontologists."

The Church of the Madonna della Misericordia was built to venerate the miraculous image of the Madonna, which was found by a person living in San Gemini municipality by chance.&#13;
In 1852, a hospice for the poorest people was founded inside the edifices annexed to the church. It remained active until 1922. In the following years the hospice was handed over to San Gemini Municipality. The former church has housed the Science of the Earth Museum since 1999.&#13;
The Science of the Earth Museum deserves attention for its particularly innovative initiative, not only at a regional but also national level.&#13;
Not only is the scientific subject a novelty, but also the way in which the visitors are introduced to and involved in the museum exhibition itinerary makes it become a live personal experience.&#13;
GeoLab is the first example of an interactive museum dedicated to the science of the Earth in Italy. It is arranged into four rooms that with the help of machines, panels, and rock and fossil samples, illustrates the evolution of the Earth, from the Pangaea to the division into larges plaques, the internal structure of our planet and the main geological characteristics of Umbria. The visitor is involved in confronting the themes along the display through the use of peculiar machines capable of reproducing a tridimensional view of the interior of the Earth, showing how our planet is made deep down until the central nucleus, and a mechanism showing the tectonic movements."

The convent, an edifice that has been documented since the 16th century, was a shelter for the pilgrims setting off towards Rome.&#13;
The not widely known figure of Guido Calori—a sculptor, painter, decorator, architect and writer about art—is properly appreciated: the display contributes to better know the figure of one of the most singular personalities in the contemporary Italian artistic panorama.&#13;
The Museo dell’Opera di Guido Calori is dedicated to the multiform Roman artist (1885-1960), a lonely figure who always strenuously defended his expressive liberty and freedom of thought.&#13;
The monastic complex, which was restored during the 1980s by the family of Massimo Calori, hosts bronze sculptures and paintings produced in the period that spans from the 1910s to the 1950s, as well as numerous sketches and instruments of work. Among the works exhibited there is the valuable bronze sculpture of Italica Gens, which was awarded on the occasion of the Biennale di Venezia in 1930. The premises also host the archive of the sculptor.&#13;
During the course of his career, Guido Calori won four awards from the Academy of San Luca in Rome—two for sculpture and two for his writing on art—he was only 17 when he received the first one."

The Museo Vulcanologico is located in the historical city center of San Venanzo, a suggestive burgh in-between the territory of the middle course of the Tiber and Orvieto. &#13;
The building housing the Museum is an early 19th century edifice adjacent to Villa Faina. &#13;
The Museum of Volcanology and its adjoining Park deserve a visit both for the peculiarity of their collections and for the environment in which the museum stands.&#13;
Among the most important finds that are kept and displayed in part of the itinerary, it is worth mentioning: a very rare kind of rock, called “Venanzite”—this rock comes from the solidification of lava—a dinosaur egg and the cranium of the Elephas Meridionalis—found in the area nearby.&#13;
In the adjoining Park visitors can take a 2-kilometer tour, along which the history of this volcano is recounted and, among other things, they can admire what remains of a quarry—evidence of the ancient extraction activities in the area—where the stones for producing millstone were extracted.&#13;
The Museum and the Park are in an area characterized by the presence of three small volcanoes, of about 500 meters in diameter and 30 meters high, that were active 265.000 years ago.&#13;
The main aim of the exhibition is therefore to illustrate the environmental and geological significance of eruptions that happened in the San Venanzo area and establish their relationship with volcanic phenomena in general.&#13;
The Museum display is organized in four rooms, in which materials of particular interest are kept, such as the Venanzite, the rock that comes from the solidification of lava whose composition is almost unique, and that helped make the little town famous all over the world. It is also worth mentioning the Dinosaur Egg from China and the Elephas Meridionalis cranium found in the area nearby.&#13;
The Museum aims at providing the visitor—who will take a tour making his own direct personal observations—with an adequate knowledge of the rocks and morphology of volcanoes in the Park. The latter is a real open-air museum—realized above the huge lava flow of Venanzite—whose pathway winds for 2 kilometers under the flow itself thanks to the emptying of the body of lava during the 1970s.&#13;
During the visit it is possible to observe cones and craters, lava flows; and some rocks and rare minerals."

It is in the same premises where the Museo D’Arte Moderna e Contemporanea “Aurelio De Felice”, an experimental theater, a cafeteria, a bookshop and some didactic laboratories are also housed. The Museum is arranged in the spaces on the ground floor of the former SIRI—acronym for Società Italiana Ricerche Industriali—factory.&#13;
The location of the Museum represents an excellent example of reuse of an industrial area in disuse. &#13;
Aspects of the life and the evolution of Terni, or Interamna—meaning ‘the town between two rivers inhabited by the Nahartes’, the Umbrian population that occupied the plain between the rivers Nera, or Nahar, and the Serra dating back to prehistory—are illustrated through the finds exhibited.&#13;
In particular, concerning the Archaeological Museum, the itinerary inaugurated in 2004 stretches over 17 rooms, and is subdivided into two sections: one dedicated to Pre-Roman history, the other to Roman history.&#13;
The Pre-Roman section, in the first rooms, exhibits the finds from Early History in rigorous chronological order—10th century B.C.—coming from the Caves around the Marmore Falls and the huge Acciaierie Necropolis, discovered at the end of the 19th century. Attended from the Late Bronze Age—10th century B.C.—to the Early Iron Age—8th century B.C.—this necropolis has produced a large number of findings, funerary goods testifying the progressive growth in the importance of monuments in burial rituals, which constitutes a sign of the changes in the social organization of the Naharci people. The central rooms display eastern-like tombs—7th century B.C.—coming from the necropolis found in town and reconstructed in the original size. The room number eight, at the end of this section, is entirely dedicated to the excavation of Monte Torre Maggiore, a place of worship, attended from the 6th century B.C. to the Late Empire.&#13;
The constituent nucleus of the Roman section derives from the initial transfer of the Sconocchia Collection into the large rooms on the ground floor of the Municipal Palace at the end of the 19th century—today the Public Library—then to the Cloister of San Francesco Convent, where they remained until the end of World War II, when the entire collection was hosted in Palazzo Carrara. &#13;
The remaining nine rooms exhibit the materials that have been regrouped following a thematic criteria based on singular aspects of everyday life and the social organization of the Interamna Nahars, from the 3rd century B.C. Roman conquest to the Late Antiquity, testified by epigraphs, the typical sculptures and funerary monuments."

The Museo D’Arte Moderna e Contemporanea “Aurelio De Felice” – CAOS, Centro Arti Opificio SIRI premises were restructured by Terni Municipality to house art collections and exhibitions in the reused space of the former SIRI factory.&#13;
The first industrial settling in the area was an old Papal Ironwork factory—the Ferriera Pontificia—built in 1793 as per the Apostolic Chamber disposition. At the time of the process of the unification of Italy—1860s—this plant was still the largest factory in Umbria, with an extension of 12.000 square meters and a labor force of about 200.&#13;
Closed down in 1905, its premises, consisting of several edifices—warehouses, offices, mineral depots and the housing of the personnel—were reused for metalwork and chemical manufacturing production destined prevalently for the armament industry in 1919. In 1925, with the guiding ideas of Luigi Casale, and after a series of changes and corporate acquisitions—like IDROS and SISAS, acronym for Società Italiana per l’Ammoniaca Sintetica—the enterprise was transformed into the current SIRI, acronym for Società Italiana Ricerche Industriali. The main activity of this enterprise was the production of synthetic ammonia and other chemical products. Starting in the 1930s, SIRI concentrated primarily on research, abandoning large production. The activity carried on without interruption until the 1970s, with a progressive slowing down of production until its definitive closure in 1983. &#13;
These works of art, dating from the 15th to the 19th century, are hosted in the new Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art, which is set up with innovative criteria. They had already been exhibited in the Municipal Gallery “Omeore Metelli”, housed in Palazzo Gazzoli. Among these, the ones of the Italian Renaissance Masters like Piermateo d’Amelia and Benozzo Gozzoli or of local artists like Niccolò Alunno, Giovanni di Pietro, known as Lo Spagna, and Pompeo Cocchi come to the fore. Collections of works such as the Naive paintings of Orneore Metelli or the sculptures of Aurelio De Felice also have their space in the museum. Visitors can also profit from the presence of graphic works of artists like Chagall, Mirò, Leger and Kandinsky. &#13;
Much space is dedicated to contemporary works of art of artists such as Turcato, Mastroianni, Pomodoro, Severini, Montanarini, Minucchi, Passalacqua, Chung Eun Mo and others.&#13;
The property of the entire area was taken over in tranches from 1997 to 2002 by the Municipality of Terni. Together with the preservation of the access alley and central court, the whole pre-existing complex was recovered and reused for Cultural and Recreational Services, while the entire first floor returned to being living quarters."

Housed in the rooms of the palace, the exhibition is subdivided in two sections: the first section testifies the religious work of art production, commissioned by the Diocese during the period of time that goes from the 15th century to the 17th century; while the second section is dedicated to local contemporary artists.&#13;
Among the works to be mentioned is the Madonna with Child and Saints Altarpiece of the Flemish artist Martin Stellaerth, the Circumcision, executed in 1560 by Livio Agresti, and the Lazarus Resurrection attributed to the Guercino workshop.&#13;
A section of the Museum is dedicated to sacred contemporary art, and collects several painting works and sculptures executed by artists of international fame that have been commissioned by the Diocese in recent years. There will be the opening of a section dedicated to textiles and goldsmith production in the near future."

	The Civic Historical Museum of Alano di Piave collects objects, documents and iconography related to the Great War of 1915-1918 and emigration. The museum is developed on three floors in addition to an external area. On the ground floor and first floor are collected the recovered materials on the battlefields of Monte Grappa and Piave River in the First World War, besides a vast collection of original documentary materials and photographic illustrations of the period; the museum&rsquo;s aim is also to feature materials collected or donated by fans, recovering the history of war&rsquo;s material. For this reason, some rooms collect materials left intentionally in conditions of excavation, as would be found by recovering, in order to remember significantly the hardness of those years.</p>
<p>
	On the ground floor is located an Italian field gun in perfect and functional condition for didactic instruction and purposes. The structure is constantly evolving to better suit the needs of perpetual regeneration exhibition through the inclusion of materials related to specific topics. The basement is dedicated to a migration section of the population of Alano di Piave, such as the end result of the war and the Great War. Here are collected everyday objects and tools used by labor migrants - especially those who emigrated as coal miners in Belgium - all items donated by the families of migrants, as well as photographic and documentary material; in the halls collecting the material can be viewed the audiovisual documents that testify the lives of immigrants. In another room was set up at a diorama of a miner while digging in a coal mine.</p>"

	The Museum is in a country villa belonging to counts of the Azzoni Avogadro familiy, surrounded by a rose garden. It enjoys a splendid panoramic position at the foot of the National Park (Parco Nazionale Dolomiti Bellunesi). It conserves and valorizes an important intangible and material heritage, about the most meaningful aspects of rural life of this area. The sections about the mobility of population are very interesting (wet nurses, emigration to South Brazil), as the sections about the adaptation of the people to the unusual character of the ground. Particular attention has been given to intangible heritage (folk-tales, legends, songs) and for this reason the expography combines different representational media: visual, sound and textual.

Now the property of the &rdquo;Comunit&agrave; Montana dell&rsquo;Alpago&ldquo;, it was conceived 25 years ago by Ivan Fossa, a keen local naturalist of Puos d&rsquo;Alpago and requested by many local naturalists and teachers (in primary, middle and secondary schools) in order to organize and conserve the wealth of local natural history in a place accessible to the public. The displays required several years of preparation and expenditure by both the &rdquo;Comunit&agrave; Montana&ldquo; and the Chies d&rsquo;Alpago municipality and have been skillfully and professionally set up with the help of the late Prof. Edoardo Semenza, professor of Zoology at the University of Ferrara, Prof. Renzo Stefani of the University of Cagliari Comparative Anatomy Department and others.<br />
	The results of many years&lsquo; careful work can be appreciated on the three floors of the building where a rich collection of all aspects of Natural Sciences in the Province of Belluno is exhibited in a didactic framework. Of particular note are the dioramas, the fungus collection, the wood specimens and the jaw of an Odontocetus (a species similar to a dolphin which lived in the ancient sea of Alpago) and, in the fish section, the Sampierolo, native to Lake Santa Croce.&nbsp;<br />

	In Pieve the family home where Titian was born. It was a solid Cadore structure of the Fifteen century &ndash; liked all the buildings of the period it represented a typical house of the higher middle class among whose members were persons of rank: notaries, timber merchants and public officials. The present house is the result of restructurings &ndash; commissioned by the Magnifica Comunit&agrave; of the Cadore, owner of the building since 1926&mdash;at the hands of the engineer Giuseppe Palatini of Pieve di Cadore, and carried out in the years 1928-30, with the demolition of the anterior part, the result of an enlargement done during the half of the Sixteen hundreds by its proprietors which had hidden the original fa&ccedil;ade. As a result of that intervention the ancient doors and windows of the original structure, of smaller dimensions typical of the Fifteenth century, came to light. The actual structure is composed of two levels in stone, of irregular design, with covered porches, an exterior wooden stair and a two sided roof covered with wood tiles. On the ground floor an ample room with a particular wooden floor houses the reproductions of the collection of Titian&rsquo;s drawings whose originals are in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, as well as other documents relating to the Painter. Once climbed the steep wooden stairs, one gains access to the upper floor, accessing the five interconnected spaces where Titian probably spent his youth and successively, after moving to Venice, each time he returned home to Pieve. In these archaic structures the spirit of the Artist still hovers: it is felt in the kitchen with a large open stove (fogher) covered by hood&mdash;the only heated room in the house, and in the adjacent utility room; it is sensed in the two bedrooms but, above all, in the warm closeness of the stua, with wood-panelled walls and rough timbered ceiling. The emotions felt while stepping on those rickety floor planks or while walking those worn-out kitchen stones that had witnessed the birth of the Genius of Renaissance painting are unforgettable.&nbsp;</p>"

	The &quot;Museum Vittorino Cazzetta&quot; was recently reopened to the public after major renovation, with a new production that showcases the extraordinary findings about the geology, paleontology and Alpine archeology. The importance of scientific exhibits and the prestige of the new building make &quot;Vittorino Cazzetta&quot; a museum of European significance, examples of the reasons that led to the recent statement by UNESCO recognizing the &quot;Dolomiti Heritage&quot;.</p>
<p>
	The Selva di Cadore Civic Museum was instituted in 1982 and its main exhibition was formed by Vittorino Cazzetta&rsquo;s fossils collection. The international importance of the discoveries in geology and archaeology, operated by this self-taught scholar, contributed to the growth of the Museum that needed a radical restructuring. In 2010, in fact, the extended building opened with a new mounting. Vittorino Cazzetta died prematurely and in a tragic way in 1996, during a mountain expedition: the Museum is now dedicated to him. This is a Paleontological Museum, Archaeological and Historical whose main exhibits are made from a Mesolithic burial discovered in full funeral Mondeval de Sora and an enormous cast of the surface of a boulder fell from Mount Pelmetto with dinosaur footprints.</p>"

	Open since 1984, the museum was set up thanks to research carried out by Forestry Inspector G. Spada and officials of the Venice State Archives in collaboration with the cultural association of the Cansiglio Cimbri, State Forestry Corps and a number of enthusiastic scholars.</p>
<p>
	The Museum&rsquo;s exhibits are divided into different sections: historical, with documents relating to the complex aspects of the long period of Venetian dominion; ethnographical regarding the Cimbri (historical notes, economic activity, linguistic aspects); economic, with panels and information sheets about the history and evolution of woodcutting, deforestation, charcoal making and animal breeding. Although the sections are different, they all have a common theme, i.e. the exploitation of the forest&rsquo;s resources by humans. Worthy of note is the three-dimensional scale model that reproduces the whole Karst plateau, affording an overall view of the main characteristics of the territory.</p>
<p>
	Really interesting are the archeological and paleoenvironmental information, results of researches which the University of Ferrara has been carrying out in Cansiglio since 1993, that testifies to uncontestable traces of the presence of Prehistoric Man perhaps from as far back as 100,000 years ago. More certain data, however, refer to a more recent prehistoric stage, thanks to the greater number of archeological sites and their better state of conservation.</p>
<p>
	Such settlements give us an idea of the relationships between the Cansiglio and groups of hunters/gatherers who frequented the plateau systematically 12,000 years ago in order to exploit the food resources offered by the woods that had grown after the last Quaternary glaciation. Man of the superior Palaeolithic era established his first camps where researchers have found instruments commonly used for survival activities (graters, spotted blades and burins for working leather, wood, horn and bone).</p>
<p>
	Of special interest is the site at Palughetto, in the vicinity of a wetland area and near the museum, where primitive Man created a deposit of pebbles to be chipped as and when needed. In fact, on the western slopes of the Pian Cansiglio many settlements from the Mesolithic era, dating from 10,000 to 8,000 years ago, have been identified due to the presence of numerous stone objects shone at museum: it is likely that some of these settlements were home to men dedicated exclusively to the preparation of hunting weapons.</p>
<p>
	These finds lead us to think that during the superior Palaeolithic and Mesolithic eras the groups of hunters-gatherers adopted a semi-nomad type of existence: during the winter they settled in the Alpago or on the Veneto-Friuli plains, and between late spring and early autumn they lived in the mountains.</p>
<p>
	The Cansiglio was also hugely important for the Venetian state: its numerous beechwoods were mainly used for the production of oars for special boats (galea), timber and charcoal. In the Museum it is possible to see both a big oar recently remade of beechwood and the ancient tools used to prepare it. A wooden model of a Venetian galea (venetian boat) will be soon exposed together with the other wooden models of a Venetian water sawmill and of a special mountain dam both used in the past in Cansiglio for the timber exploitation.</p>"

	Villa Beatrice was named after Saint Beatrice who lived here between 1221 and 1226. On the site of the villa, a small coenobium stood once earlier inhabited by hermits. Beatrice descended from the noble family D&#39;Este, which, before moving to Ferrara, had ruled over the town of Este and over part of Padua territories. She took vows in the small nunnery of Saint Margherita of Salarola, located between Mount Cero and Mount Castello; in 1221 she moved to Mount Gemola and there restored an abandoned convent. Beatrice lived here sharing her strong religious fervor with her fellow nuns until 1226, when she died from tuberculosis. The news of Beatrice&#39;s sainthood quickly spread all over the district and many generous offers and gifts were given to the nunnery. In 1576 the nuns of the convent of Gemola were moved to Padua and the remains of Santa Beatrice were brought the church of Santa Sofia.</p>
<p>
	In 1657, after a period in which the nunnery lied in a state of neglect, it appears to be the property of a Venetian merchant. The transformation of the convent into a villa dates to this period; the &ldquo;barchessa&rdquo; was only added in the early 21st century, greatly spoiling the area of the old cemetery. The accurate survey realized before the building refurbishment promoted by public authorities in 1970s and 1980s revealed important traces of the ancient convent.</p>

	The castle of San Martino della Vanezza, located on the south bank of river Bacchiglione, represents an interesting example of defense building. It was once part of a large defensive line that stretched as far as Este passing through the Euganean hills area. The oldest part of the monumental complex - the tower - was erected around 1000 AD. Under the rule of the family d&agrave; Carrara, the tower was further raised and other buildings were added. Also the small trachyte palisade on the south side was probably rebuilt at that time. During the Venetian domination the castle was converted into a river port.<br />
	Today the castle hosts the Museum of the River Bacchiglione which is divided into two sections: the archaeological section and the geomorphologic section. The archaeological rooms show objects dated to pre-Roman and Roman Age found inside Bacchiglione river in the stretch between Cervarese Santa Croce and Ponte San Nicol&ograve;. Two rooms have a great number of medieval and modern potteries on display. The geomorphologic section hosts the oak monoxylons found in 1972 in the river near the bridge of Selvazzano Dentro and dated to 8th century AD (using carbon dating). The section also includes a cartographic route showing hydrographic changes of this area.&nbsp;<br />

The idea to refurbish the complex and use it as the site of this original museum was conceived after the find of Cretaceous fossil fish specimens (dated 92 million years ago) made around the mid-70s in the limestone quarry near the kiln. The finding represents the core of the geologic exhibition which is introduced by a didactic section on Earth sciences showing geological phenomena of the Euganean Hills area. The mineralogy section hosts a collection of minerals coming from all over the world. The last section displays the substantial &#39;Da Rio&#39; geologic collection and stands as a typical example of scientific museum of the first half of the 19th century. The collection includes minerals, stones and fossils gathered between the end of the 18th century and the first half of the 19th century by count Niccol&ograve; Da Rio, a literate and a notable natural sciences researcher from Padua. An open-air geologic park has been recently inaugurated to make room for large stone specimens and full-scale models of prehistoric animals.</p>"

	&ldquo;Near Porta Padova we are dominated by the compact volume of the so called Torre di Malta. It rests on a rough basement in concretionary cobblestone about 5 metres high and consists of several storeys, with holes and arrow slits, and with rests of summit stone corbels reaching 21 metres. It is a rather early work. Starting at least from 1256, our sources attest the existence just past Porta Padova of a &ldquo;girone&rdquo;, that is a defensive reduit based on a robust keep, where Ezzelino da Romano&rsquo;s captain found his last refuge against the besiegers.<br />
	In the following years the two podest&agrave; of Cittadella had to take turns of duty to remain there with fifteen guards, among whom five perfectly equipped crossbowmen. Its present aspect, however, is the result of later reconstruction, perhaps already in the 14th century. Certainly in the 15th century it was still known as the &ldquo;Ziron&rdquo;.<br />
	The tradition has it that here was constructed the notorious Malta, that is the prison wanted by Ezzelino, built in 1251, which for five years continuously swallowed the &ldquo;tyrant&rsquo;s&rdquo; political opponents.<br />
	The victims of this hellish prison were known to be brought by the dozen, completely dried up, to be buried outside Porta Bassano, in the same place where after 1260 the nunnery of the Camposanto (Graveyard) was founded as a sign of devout memory (this latter circumstance, however, leads us to think that not here, but in the dark caves of Porta Bassano was located the horrible gaol passed to history also because Dante is believed to have made a reference to it).<br />
	Now the spacious rooms of the tower host quite a rich collection of archaeological finds, coming from Cittadella and its surroundings going from the Bronze Age to the Renaissance and forming the nucleus of the Civic Archaeological Museum.&quot;<br />

	The Municipal Museum of Montagnana is located in Castello di San Zeno, the most ancient part of the town fortifications. The construction of the big donjon dates back to 1242; in the 14th century the Carraresi enlarged the Castello, finishing the famous town wall. The Museum was established in 1980.<br />
	Room I of the Museum contains materials of Prehistoric and Proto-historic Age. The most ancient finds date back to Late-Neolithic and Aeneolithic Age (end of&nbsp;4th-3rd millennium B.C.). The most late phase of the Iron Age is documented by the outfit of a rich male grave. Here we can observe the Celtic custom of burying the dead man with his weapons and tools of the trade: a sword with its sheath, a point of a lance, a large knife, a shear. The Roman Age (in Room II) is documented by numerous archaeological finds, that go from the Augustan Age to the Late-Imperial Age, belonging to both country houses and graveyards, that testify a peopling spread on the territory, often positioned on Adige river rises. Sepulchral monuments and funerary furnishings are in any case more important and of great value. Graves are mostly cremation graves in ditches or tile box graves; outfits are extremely rich and belong to a family graveyard of the gens Vassidia, probably landowner of the area. As far as stony monuments are concern, there is a very important and big stele in biancone marble, bas-relief decorated and with a long writing on the right part.<br />
	Medieval and Modern section is composed of three different kind of materials about history and buildings of the walled town. Among the paintings (Room IV), two fresco panels representing a Virgin in throne with two Saints, and St. Prosdocimo and St. Giustina (a wise executive quality in the wake of Altichiero da Zevio&#39;s lesson), La carit&agrave; by Alessandro Varotari, a.k.a. the Padovanino, and a late Mos&egrave; by Antonio Zanchi. The collection of ceramics (Room III-IV) is more rich and offers by fragments a view on the production of Montagnana and the relationship with the neighbouring art centres, such as Legnago, Este and Padova, produced in the late age of the Carraresi (14th century), and the later production.<br />
	The last section (Room V) includes the materials given to the native Municipality of Montagnana especially by the heirs of the tenors Giovanni Martinelli (1885-1969) and Aureliano Pertile (1885-1952), famous protagonists of the Opera Theatre of the first half of the 20th century. Aureliano Pertile arrived at La Scala Theatre in Milan in 1916 with Francesca da Rimini by Zandonai. After some tours in South America and in New York (Metropolitan), Pertile was called again to La Scala in 1922, where he was Toscanini&rsquo;s favourite interpreter (operas by Donizetti, Bellini, Verdi, Auber, Massenet, Puccini, Mascagni, Respighi, Wolf-Ferrari, and also Wagner and Musorgskij, showing his rare eclecticism). Composer Giacomo Puccini called Giovanni Martinelli as interpreter of La fanciulla del West at S. Carlo Theatre in Naples, in 1911; the following year, giving his first performance at Covent Garden in London with Tosca, he was greeted as &quot;a new Caruso&quot;. He was engaged unceasingly from 1913 to 1945 at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York. The documents kept at the Municipal Museum of Montagnana are original photos, playbills and other proofs of the two great singers&#39; activity. There is also a very interesting collection of theatre dresses worn by Martinelli in operas performed at the Metropolitan between 1914 and 1925, and some Pertile&#39;s relics as well.<br />

	The centrally located Piazza Eremitani contains the City Museums, i.e., the Archaeological Museum and the Museum of Medieval and Modern Art, housed in the cloisters of the old monastery of the Eremitani monks. The Scrovegni Chapel also forms part of this complex of buildings. The original nucleus of Padova&#39;s City Museums can still be recognized in the rich collections which became public property with the suppression of the Convento di San Giovanni da Verdara (1783) and other religious bodies (1810). In 1825, Abbot Giuseppe Furlanetto placed a collection of Venetic, Greek and Roman stone tablets in the loggias of the Palazzo della Ragione (also called &quot;Il Salone&quot;), which was inaugurated by Francis I of Austria with the name of Museum. Then, thanks to the passionate commitment of Andrea Gloria, these pieces became part of the city&#39;s collections of works of art, together with the contents of private libraries and the old archives of the city&#39;s Magistrature. They later became the Pinacoteca (Art Gallery), Biblioteca (Library) and Archivio (Archive), the latter passing to the Italian State in 1948.</p>"

	The Museum of PRECINEMA - Minici Zotti Collection From Magic Lanterns to the Cinema<br />
	In Prato della Valle on the last floor of the monumental Palazzo Angeli, visitors can enjoy the Minici Zotti Collection whose items were brought together with the aim of valuing and diffusing knowledge about the origins of the idea of projecting images onto a screen.<br />
	The museum, promoted by the Padua Municipality, is a jewel in the crown for the City. It includes instruments and optical games, rare iconographic and bibliographic materials, musical instruments and above all a significant number of Magic Lanterns and projection slides that bear witness to the fascinating journey of fixed and animated images from the 18th century to the birth of Cinema. There are specific sectors devoted to photography, stereoscopy and Magic Lanterns.<br />
	The Magic Lantern is an optical instrument invented in the mid-17th century for projecting onto a screen small painted images or photographs on glass, to produce a magnified image. Projection slides, that are true miniatures on glass, may produce either fixed or moving images with the aid of small, complicated mechanisms. The series devoted to Astronomy, to the funny characters, to fantastic apparitions, to the dissolving of light between day and night, to moralizing stories, to the aurora borealis of the North Pole, to fairy-tales and legends constitute the most successful iconographic subjects of the 18th and 19th centuries. The series dedicated to the Grand Tour takes us on a journey in the footsteps of the scions of noble families as they made their educational journey across Europe. There are also scientific subjects with &ldquo;les projections vivantes&rdquo;, the surprising effects of &quot;mechanical paintings&quot; with fountains that spurt water, volcanic eruptions, snow, rain, lightning, rainbows and rare erotic images, and finally the Cromatropes, suggestive colour projections that produce effects that are similar to the rose windows of Gothic cathedrals. In 1895 the Cinema was born and sadly enough the Magic Lantern was packed and moved to the attics. Considered to be the ancestor of cinema by narrow minds, for centuries it offered the audiences of its time what used to be called &quot;Marvellous Show&quot;.<br />
	The visit of the museum begins with the evocative &quot;Campiello delle Maravegie&quot; which welcomes the visitor upon his arrival. In the 18th century, you would run into extravagant people in the streets of Venice and of the whole of Europe, entertaining passersby with optical visions and with the Peep Show, &quot;an ingenious machine&quot; that for a few pennies would show people &quot;many wonders&quot;, in the words of Carlo Goldoni.<br />
	Like all private collections, also this one reflects the taste of its creator, Laura Minici Zotti, collector, &quot;lanternist&quot; and director of the Museum who has been collecting items on the pre-cinema era for a long time now, attaching priority to those she fancies most. The aim of the Museum is to enable people to get to know more about this overlooked aspect of vision, and it organizes itinerant exhibitions about Stereoscopy and Silhouettes.<br />
	The next exhibition is on the French Shadow Theatres. The shadow show cut on zinc was invented in Paris at the Cabaret du Chat Noir, a famous entertainment place starting from 1881.<br />
	With a staff and management who are clearly passionate about the topic, this small museum displays a fascinating collection of items. The museum also features an excellent array of antiques, and interactive exhibits that allow visitors to explore the ingenious pre-cinema methods of illusion.<br />

	The Museo Veneto del Giocattolo was established in 2006. Its aim is to save and give again a life and worth to old toys. These toys form the largest collection of playthings ever harvested in Veneto Region, which can count on very precious and rare specimens dated from the end of 19th century up to 1970s. The museum shows different kinds of toys: car, train, boat, airplane models as well as tin soldiers, dolls and games which have been produced in Italy and abroad. There are seven different sections which define the type of plaything. One special wing is fully dedicated to rare and famous items produced by INGAP, a famous toy factory from Padua.<br />
	The set of the Museum is continuously improving and enlarging, thanks to the great generosity and the donations of some collectors. The mission is not only to preserve the historic and artistic value of these playthings of the past, but and especially to enhance the interaction of the children with toys, by encouraging creativity and promote relationships one each other through the game. The objects shown in the Museum are not only a great witness of the artistic and crafts skills, but they are a sort of junction vehicle between different generations, which can bridge together in a simple but very realistic way.<br />
	It is because of the above that we decided to place the Museum in Civitas Vitae, a multifunctional centre where longevity is really the main goal. The 12,000 square meters of gardens, building and living spaces gives renovated worth to aged people. It is owned by Opera Immacolata Concezione Foundation and in particular a group of persons from Agor&agrave; association (Members of the Group Terza Et&agrave; Protagonista) have been trained to cooperate in the Museum to make the relationship between old toys and today children finally possible and lively.<br />
	The aim of these aged but very active people, associated in the &ldquo;Nonni del Cuore&rdquo; organisation is to maintain alive past experiences and restore them to young generations. The result is a renovated individual and community identity, which is ground of growth for nowadays kids.<br />
	By exploring the Museum young visitors will be introduced to old toys by a &ldquo;Nonni del Cuore&rdquo;&rsquo;s narration. Plaything is becoming in this way the bridge and the communication mean between generations.<br />
	The Museo Veneto del Giocattolo organises guided tours to schools and intergeneration labs with the help of the &ldquo;Nonni del Cuore&rdquo;.<br />
	Often some events are organised in cooperation with the local institutions. A fruitful partnership with Museo di Rovereto has been established.<br />

	The original 18th century plant, purchased in 1859 by entrepreneur Vincenzo Breda, underwent a major restructuring in the years 1864-65 by the architect Antonio Vicenza Caregaro Negrin that radically changed the structure, divided according to the eclectic taste of the time. Inside the park is still practiced today in the historic stables, horse breeding and training of trotters at the track training.<br />
	Recently restored and renovated, &quot;Villa Breda&quot; is now a prestigious museum divided into several sections and can accommodate major temporary exhibitions.<br />
	The museum, located in Villa Breda, is divided into three sections: the first houses the museum of municipal water and gas in Padua, the second one is dedicated to the museum of horseracing, and the third&nbsp;section houses the museum moral and historical entity.

	In 1476, the Confraternity of St Roch purchased a building in which to hold the meetings of the chapter. In 1525, work began on the present-day building, composed of two large halls, one above the other, which received the Bishop&#39;s blessing in 1542. In 1697, the altar-piece showing The Virgin and the Saints, by Alessandro Maganza, was placed on the altar in the lower hall.<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;An inside staircase leads to the upper hall, at least partly frescoed (decoration began in 1559) and enriched by the large altar frontal, in stucco, by Tiziano Minio, showing St. Roch and two saints.<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;After long negotiations with the State, in 1925 the Oratory became the property of the City of Padova, which contributed to the expenses necessary for restorations, carried out between 1926 and 1929. The plaster of the fa&ccedil;ade was repaired, and that of the western wall was removed.<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Inside the Oratory, the ceiling and vaults had to be refaced in cement. The painter Luigi&nbsp; Cherubini reproduced the original decoration. The beams supporting the ceiling of the lower hall were also repaired, a new floor was laid down, and the walls were reinforced.<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A later series of restorations, in response to the urgent need for repairs, was carried out in 1950. On that occasion, about 20 square metres of frescoes to the right of the altar were detached, cleaned, and set back in place.<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Other partial repair operations in the 1960s and 1970s failed to solve the general situation of deterioration of the frescoes. The latest work was finished in 1993.</p>"

	Within the chronologically arranged itinerary, some interiors have been reconstructed, so that visitors can enter into the spirit of people&#39;s lives at various moments in time and appreciate the development of taste and of the many artistic techniques used to create such objects. In addition, the display of several objects belonging to the same period demonstrates how the working methods of artists in their studios and craftsmen in their workshops, differed, but at the same time enhanced each other.</p>

	On the second floor is the Bottacin Museum, comprising the entire collection of Nicola Bottacin, the wealthy merchant who donated all his art works and coins to the city of Padova in 1865. In an ideal reconstruction of the furniture and furnishings of his villa in Trieste are exhibited paintings, furniture, sculpture, Chinese ceramics, ancient weapons, and other works acquired to decorate Bottacin&#39;s enormous home. A second itinerary is devoted to the more specific collection on the history of money, which makes the Bottacin Museum one of the most prestigious numismatic institutions in Europe, thanks also to later donations.

	The Museum of Contemporary Art &ldquo;Dino Formaggio&rdquo; started is public activity in October 1993. The Museum hosts an important collection of paintings and sculptures dating from the end of the 19th. century to the present time and it represents a farsighted cultural and touristic achievement of the Teolo&rsquo;s municipality, thanks to long work of a great man and citizen of this town, the philosopher and Professor Dino Formaggio.<br />
	The Museum, which includes almost a hundred different artist&rsquo;s works, gives today the possibility to see the paintings and sculptures made by some of the most celebrated names in the History and Critic of Art such as the Italians Medardo Rosso, Francesco Paolo Michetti, Angelo Dall&rsquo;Oca Bianca, Vincenzo Irolli, Aligi Sassu, Renato Birolli, Fiorenzo Tomea, Italo Valenti, Tono Zancanaro, Carmelo Cappello, Tito Gasparini and the famous foreign artists Vilim Sve&ccedil;niak from Zagabria, Gugo Manizer from Moscow, Sylvain Nuccio and Bartolomeo Trombini from Nimes and the Mexican Julia L&oacute;pez.<br />
	The Museum&rsquo;s dedication to Professor Dino Formaggio is a due acknowledgement to his twenty-years presence in town, while he was teaching Aesthetics at the University of Padua and later became dean and eventually temporary chancellor of it, with several national and international awards for it and for his works. His has been the collecting and bequest of all the works of art exhibited in the Museum, and he has been the curator, until his death in 2008.<br />
	This very fact is as well the most special trait of the real peculiarity which countermarks the Museum itself, whose formation is indeed the result of the generous solidarity and exchange among several artists who, starting to meet in 1938 as members of the famous &ldquo;Corrente&rdquo; cultural group in Milano (led by the artist Ernesto Treccani), have all been tied together for many years in a rich and deep conversation with Art.<br />
	And thus today the Museum of Teolo is a concrete presence which can be seen by the Italian and international visitors coming to stay shortly or longer in the &ldquo;Colli Euganei&rdquo; district. It is meant for those who want to vacate firmly and so to enjoy well the gifts of nature, together with those still precious of Art.<br />

The building on the left hosts the ethnographic section, with the reconstruction of a farm house with a tavern attached. The building on the right hosts the naturalistic section and the history of Cappello&#39;s Court.<br />
	The Museum is still new, it is growing thank to the villagers&#39; contribution, they make it more and more complete with objects and with their experiences of life. Some typical environments of the farmers from Polesine have been rebuilt in the ethnographic section: on the ground floor there are a country tavern of the 1950s and the kitchen with its characteristic fireplace; on the mezzanine there are the bedroom and the loft with children&#39;s toys and various objects of every day. On the walls there are lots of photographs showing some crafts of last century, most of which are now disappeared.<br />
	In the entrance hall of the naturalistic section, there are, first of all, some boards that show the history of the Court: formation of the land, first villages, installation of the noble Venetian family Cappello, the court evolution. In the same room the visitor is introduced to the world of birds by some boards that show their general characteristics and a big reconstruction of a Pterosaur (a reptile with wingspan of about 8 meters, that lived 70-100 million years ago.

	The Museum of the Long Rivers that belongs to the Civic Administration of Rovigo, was officially opened on 20th April 2001. It continues and develops the activity of the former Civic Museum of Polesine Civilizations, founded in 1978. It has been using and evaluating the old Olivetan Monastery of Saint Bartholomew, since a complex and radical restoration work took place. The Monastery was founded in the 13th century and was abolished in the time of Napoleon. Between the 16th and 17th century the existence of the Olivetan Order allowed the widening of the building to the present dimension, with two cloisters - one of which houses a beautiful well curb - and two courtyards. It is one of the most important architectonical complexes of Rovigo and Polesine.<br />
	The new Museum is meant to be inserted in a plan of promotion of Polesine. It highlights the history and environment peculiarities of the territory of the province of Rovigo - hemmed in between the final stretches of the longest Italian rivers and characterized by the Po Delta. It opens a proactive dialogue and a constructive cooperation with local, Italian and European cultural institutions concerned with river environments and deltaic areas. It is an innovative Museum that uses advanced technologies to communicate information to the public: in fact, beside the traditional series of glass cases and archaeological finds, there are virtual reconstructions, computers, stage settings, dioramas and scale models that take the visitors to an imaginary journey through the basic stages of their history.<br />

	The Museum of Natural History and Archaeology, founded in 1984, is organised into 3 sections:<br />
	a) a natural science section subdivided into two subsections: Earth Sciences (5 halls) and Life Sciences (6 halls);&#8232;<br />
	b) an archaeological section subdivided into two subsections: prehistory-protohistory (Ancient Venetians) and Roman age;&#8232;<br />
	c) a detached section in Schievenin di Quero (BL).&#8232;&#8232;<br />
	The natural science collections on display at the museum include closed historical collections dating back to the 18th and 19th centuries, and recent collections donated to or directly acquired by the museum. Most of those collections are closely linked either to the regional or the Italian territory. Nevertheless, there are also exotic collections of insects, birds, fish and mammals; mineral and geo-paleontological collections featuring pieces from all over the world are also on display .<br />
	The archaeological collections are mostly government-owned and stored at the museum and, only partially, municipality-owned. They are the result of donated materials collected prior to 1909 or of materials coming from abroad. The show-pieces stem from surface collections or excavations that took place in Montebelluna and its surroundings over the years.<br />

	Oderzo&rsquo;s Archaeological Museum &ldquo;Eno Bellis&rdquo; is situated in the Barchessa of Palazzo Foscolo. The urban structure of the ancient town of &quot;Opitergium&quot;, an important economic and administrative centre during the ancient Veneto and Roman ages, originated from the 10th century B.C. and remained as it was until the 7th century AD. Museum collections started in the late 19th century when early findings were supplemented with donations from local families. More recently, other artefacts were added.<br />
	Objects are displayed by order of ages: the first floor houses artefacts of the Pre-Roman Age from the town and its surrounding area. Special features of this section are two decorative animal-shaped terracotta statues, some small bronze figurines of charging warriors, Venetic inscriptions and the Tomb 49, containing the complete skeleton of a stallion with his rich iron and bronze harness fittings. The first floor also houses the full scale reconstruction of drainage systems using amphorae dating back to the Roman Age and the main amphora specimen found locally.<br />
	The Roman age itinerary continues on the ground floor with artefacts of the Romans everyday life, tombstones (many of which decorated with memorial busts), a collection of coins and small bronze statues, some valuable portraits and famous mosaics of the Late antiquity. Eight fragments pertaining to the so-called &rdquo;hunting&ldquo; mosaic depict scenes from daily life and hunting activities, as well as two other fragments portraying a cup-bearer and a hare-hunting scene.<br />
	There are several evocative open-air archaeological sites scattered around the town centre. Four sites are particularly worth mentioning: the Forum area contains the remains of a Forum of the Earlier Roman Imperial Age and of a big domus (house); the area of the former jails, situated inside a renowned restaurant; the area of Via dei Mosaici, where the lower part of two wells and the mosaic paving of a noble dwelling are preserved; and the area between Piazza Grande and Piazza Castello, where a tunnel has been built inside a modern building between the squares to show visitors the remains of one of the two main Roman town roads and paved floor displayed vertically.&nbsp;<br />

	The Pinacoteca Alberto Martini occupies the top floor of Palazzo Foscolo, a fine late 16th-century building in the tradition of the Venetian villas, the rich Sansovino-style stuccowork of which, together with the procession of first-floor portals, has been attributed to Alessandro Vittoria (Trento 1524 - Vicenza 1608). Since 1997, Palazzo Foscolo has also accommodated the Oderzo Gallery of Modern and Contemporary Painting (GAMCO). The creation of the Pinacoteca Alberto Martini coincides with the anthological exhibition of his works that Oderzo organised in 1967. On that occasion, Maria Petringa, the artist&rsquo;s widow, made a donation of his Self-portrait (1911), which thus became the first precious work and cornerstone of the collection. A few years later, other pieces were added, and in 1970 the Town Council officially founded the Alberto Martini Art Gallery. In time, further generous bequests (from Petringa once more, then Anderloni and Tischer, Martini&rsquo;s heirs and Fondazione Oderzo Cultura ONLUS) increased the collection, which today numbers 700 works. Characterized by a theory of subtle and elegant lecterns in steel and glass, the new art itinerary created in 2006 means to illustrate the artist and the man. The most important cycles of work of graphic art on paper are collected and shown along the rooms, while, on the walls, many of the painted masterpieces belonging to the most important creative periods are combined with some aesthetic considerations and thoughts taken from his autobiographical manuscript &rdquo;Vita d&rsquo;artista&ldquo;(1939-1940). A big show case, in the entry hall, collects and exposes some of the numerous documents, letters and objects coming from his personal archive (AMART, available here).&nbsp;</p>"

These include famous masterpieces, such as Klimt&rsquo;s Judith II (Salom&egrave;, 1909) and Chagall&rsquo;s Rabbi of Vitebsk (1914-1922).<br />
	One of the museum&rsquo;s strengths is its vast collection of sculptures, including works in wax by Medardo Rosso, donated to the museum by the artist in 1914. Further acquisitions and bequests have endowed the museum with notable works, from Kandinsky to Klee, from Matisse to Moore and Wildt, as well as a rich selection of works by Italian artists and an important cabinet of graphic art.<br />
	After the great restoration work of 2002, (a project by Boris Podrecca), since 2009 the exhibition area has been extended to the second monumental piano nobile of the palazzo. On the third floor is the Oriental Art Museum, which can be visited with the same ticket.<br />

The exhibits illustrate the thousand-year-long history of the island and its relations with the mainland and with Venice, evoking the past of a place suspended between water and earth and the sea-changes it went through along the centuries owing to natural causes or the action of man. The permanent displays present finds that testify to the intense trade involving the lagoon and its inhabitants starting from the Mycenaean period (2nd millennium B.C.), and gather various material from the early-Veneto, pre-Roman, Roman, Byzantine, and early medieval periods. The glorious days of the Serenissima are given ample testimony up till the 19th century.</p>"

	A masterpiece of Gothic Architecture, the Doge&rsquo;s Palace is an accumulation of layer upon layer of building work and ornamentation, comprising the original foundations, the 14th-15th century structure, sizeable Renaissance additions and opulent Mannerist details. The structure is made up of three large blocks that incorporate previous constructions. The wing looking out towards St. Mark&rsquo;s Basin (and containing the Hall of the Great Council) is the oldest, and was rebuilt from 1340 onwards. The wing towards the Piazza (formerly known as the Court Rooms) contains the Sala dello Scrutinio and was built in its present form from 1424 onwards. The canal-side wing, housing the Doge&rsquo;s apartments and many of the offices of government, dates from the Renaissance and was built in the period 1483-1565.<br />
	The public entrance to the Doge&rsquo;s Palace is through the Porta del Frumento [Forage Gateway], so-called because the &rdquo;Fodder Office&rdquo; was located nearby; this is approached through the colonnade under the 14th century waterfront facade. On the ground floor are located the public services and the Museum of the Palace Fabric; what used to be the palace kitchens are now partly occupied by the Cafeteria and also by a space for temporary exhibitions. The visit to the upper floors starts in the extraordinary courtyard, from where you pass up to the Loggia on the first floor (where the Doge&rsquo;s Apartments are located) and then to the Institutional Chambers, which are spread over the first and second floor.

	Verona&#39;s gallery of modern art is situated in Palazzo Forti, part of a block of buildings occupying what was originally a Roman site and now bounded by the roads Via Forti, Via Massalongo, Corso Sant&#39;Anastasia, and Vicolo Due Mori. The original structure of Palazzo Forti was built in the 13th century.<br />
	In 1937 Achille Forti, an illustrious botanist and the last of the Forti line, left the complex to the city of Verona which, in accordance with his wishes, converted it into a museum of modern art. After just a year the museum closed and was to reopen only after the war, first as an art school and then as the administration offices of town council until about 1950.<br />
	In 1966 Professor Licisco Magagnato superintended further restorations and revealed the medieval structures. In the meantime, though for just a few months, the museum began to function again, only to be closed, with the exception of a few shows, until the 1980s.<br />
	In 1982 the city council decided on the definitive establishment of the gallery which was inaugurated on 14th March of the same year. Since then the gallery has organised many important exhibitions dedicated to the most significant artists and movements of the national and international scene such asVan Gogh, Munch, Degas, Toulouse Lautrec, Picasso, Modigliani, de Chirico, Magritte, Klee, Kandinsky, Malevich, Chagall until Marc Quinn.<br />
	Among the objectives of the Gallery there are conservation, enhancement and promotion of its collection through a corpus of about 1300 works of modern and contemporary art with works by artists of great importance as Medardo Rosso, Vanessa Beecroft, Francesco Hayez, Fabrizio Plessi, Felice Casorati Giulio Paolini, etc..<br />

The Museum has a twofold goals: at the ethnographic level to help people and visitors of all ages, cultures and paths of life to know better and to appreciate Africa and its cultural richness and at the didactic level as a means to offer school children and their teachers the occasion to increase their knowledge about Africa in its geographical, historical and cultural aspects. Students - at the same time - will have also the chance to take active part in didactic laboratories connected with the permanent exhibition of the Museum.<br />

The first aspect underlined by the Museum is the importance of fertility and motherhood in Africa, the journey then proceeds describing the different stages through which each person goes: infancy, childhood, education, initiation, marriage, family life, work, adulthood and authority, old age, death and the other world. The &lsquo;cycle of life&rsquo; is portrayed through artefacts (sculptures, masks, musical instruments &hellip;.) and every day tools used mostly in traditional African settings.

	Construction on the theatre dates to the last quarter of the first century B .C., during the height of the Augustan age. Building continued for several decades, resulting in a magnificent structure set in an urban context of great beauty. The recovery of the remains of the theatre, begun in 1834 under the patronage of Andrea Monga, a wealthy Veronese citizen who purchased all of the surrounding houses that had been built over the centuries, has proved that the edifice respects the architectural canons of this building type: the seating area for spectators, divided in two sections and vertically in wedges; the semi-circular orchestra at the foot of the staircase; the stage, for the actors. During the summer the theatre hosts numerous theatrical and musical events. The Archaeological Museum was founded in 1923 in the former fourteenth-century Jesuit convent of San Girolamo, situated above the theatre. The collection includes Greek vases, mosaics, sculpture, glass objects and items of everyday use from ancient burial sites, as well as sacred and tomb inscriptions found in Verona and its provinces.</p>"

	Palazzo Pompei, headquarters of the Civic Museum of Natural History of Verona, is among the most important buildings of the city from an historical and architectural perspective. Commissioned by the wealthy Lavezzola family between 1530 and 1550 to the brilliant architect Michele Sanmicheli, it belonged later to the Pompei family; in 1833, Count Alessandro Pompei donated it to the Municipality of Verona, to house exhibits as well as artistic and scientific collections of great prestige and importance for the city. The original core of the building was expanded, since 1858, progressively including adjacent areas and houses.<br />
	Today, inside the broad spaces of this Palazzo are included fourteen exhibition rooms, the library, the laboratories, the collections depositories and the offices of the Museum. The Civic Museum of Natural History of Verona houses the scientific departments devoted to the study of minerals and rocks, paleontology and zoology, whereas the prehistory and botany branches are held in the &quot;Palazzina Comando dell&rsquo;Arsenale Austriaco di Verona&quot;. The scientific material collected by the researchers of the Museum, as well as by many naturalists in the course of nearly five centuries, today is being prepared and catalogued, studied and finally included in the collections or shown to the public in the exhibit rooms. Therefore, the Museum carries out a central and decisive role in scientific research and in the publishing of scientific studies and popular works. Its education and communication department is devoted to the dissemination of the natural science culture toward different public groups (schools, adults, families, associations, etc.) and it is also very active.<br />
	A section of the Civic Museum of Natural History of Verona is entirely dedicated to the fossils of Bolca: a most extraordinary evidence of Earth&rsquo;s evolution impressed in the rock as it were the pages of a book. From the Bolca area in the Lessini Mounts, 50 km from Verona, come fossil samples of more than 250 species of animals and 200 plants; a fascinating cross-section of life on Earth 50 million years ago.&nbsp;<br />

	The convent complex of San Francesco al Corso dates to the 13th century. In 1935, Antonio Avena, director of the Civic Museums, opened to the public the so-called &rdquo;Tomb of Juliet&ldquo;. This site, according to legend, is where the sarcophagus holding the bodies of Romeo and Juliet was placed, and it naturally became a tourist attraction.</p>

	One of the oldest public museums in Europe, the Lapidario (with collections of Greek, Etruscan, Paleo-Veneta and Roman, as well as Arab epigraphs) was founded in 1745 by one of Verona&rsquo;s most illustrious figures, Scipione Maffei, whose personal collection formed the basis of the museum&rsquo;s holdings. Located at a site within the antique walls that join Piazza Bra and Castelvecchio, the museum was conceived as a sort of access garden to the Philharmonic Academy. The Academy, as of 1612, had acquired some 28 epigraphs which were displayed in the courtyard in front of their building.<br />
	The initial transformation of this collection into a true museum was due to the efforts of Scipione Maffei; the museum was subsequently acquired by the city (1883) and was reinstalled in a contemporary style in 1982. The epigraphic materials and reliefs are arranged in chronological sections in the courtyard, from which one enters the Philharmonic theatre foyer, the underground level, and two upper-level rooms. From this point a connecting walkway over the Della Scala walls leads to the Gran Guardia.</p>"

	The Miniscalchi-Erizzo museum belongs to the homonymous Foundation. The Institute is in a whole of adjoining buildings in the heart of the ancient town, between piazza Erbe and the Cathedral.<br />
	The main part of the building from which you enter the Museum is a jewel of late-gothic architecture, unique in the urban Veronese context. The facade, built on three registers, is marked, in particular, by a precious ogival portal splayed in marble trichromatism and by two big mullioned windows which open at the centre of the piano nobile. The building construction dates back to the last quarter of the 15th century and it is ascribed to Angelo di Giovanni, a stone artist of Lombard origin active in Verona.<br />
	In 1880, close to the 15th century building, the solemn, classic-style palace was built with its fa&ccedil;ade looking out on to via Giuseppe Garibaldi, based on the plan by the architect Gustaveus Strauss; the building faces a wide unclosed courtyard. The tympanum is noteworthy, entirely decorated with a big relief represented the Miniscalchi-Erizzo coat-of-arms, surrounded by the earl&#39;s coronate, hand circle by ornamental greenery patterns and by a ribbon where the following words are engraved: &quot;ex concordia fratrum&quot;.<br />
	Through a wide atrium, rich in remains of the original structure of the 15th century building, you enter the neoclassical great staircase which leads to the first floor, where, through fifteen rooms, the Museum is prepared. On the ground floor an equipped space also opens, obtained from the former stables, destined to the temporary exhibitions which the Museum prepares or houses.<br />
	Each expositive room of the Museum is characterised by the presence of specific collections: small Renaissance bronzes, drawings of the 16th century masters, archaeological collections, Renaissance weapons and armours, sacred art, furniture of the Venetian 18th century, ivories, majolica objects, china. The whole arranged according to current museum criteria, but placed, thanks to paintings and old furniture, in the residence where the Miniscalchi family lived for five centuries. The reconstituted &quot;Wunderkammer&quot; of Ludovico Moscardo (great collector and learned man of the 17th century), the ancient library and the home chapel complete and enrich the museum course.<br />

	The museum exhibits a rich collection of fossils of a tropical marine environment, which were found near the fossil deposit known as the &rdquo;Pesciara di Bolca&rdquo;, rightfully considered the most important in the world for the fish fossils of the Tertiary Era. Petrified plants, fish, insects, mollusks and crustaceans are shown to visitors in all of their extraordinary beauty, even with their original colouring. With generous captions, drawings and reconstructions, the phenomena that occurred in the area of Bolca some 50 million years ago are also illustrated. The museum itinerary can be completed with a visit to the &ldquo;Pesciara&rdquo; (on booking), a cave in a gallery situated not far from the museum, from where the rocky layers containing the fossils are extracted.&nbsp;</p>"

	The Museum is one of the oldest museums of Veneto and was established in 1828 after the donation of the naturalist Giambattista Brocchi; it consists of a Museum, a Library and an Archive and it is located from 1840 in the former convent next to Saint Francis Church. In this building several collections owned by the Museum are displayed: archaeological collection (4462 pieces), coin collection (8453 pieces), the paintings of the picture gallery (728 pieces), the graphical collection (19488 pieces) and the Canova&rsquo;s Legacy (1815 pieces not including the correspondence). In 1831 a small group of paintings was displayed in the rooms next to the Saint Francis cloister; in 1840 some paintings from the Council Room of the Town Hall were added, then the natural History collections and the books donated by Giambattista Brocchi.<br />
	The entire heritage increased during the years and nowadays only a small part of it can be admired and studied; this small part is displayed in the Archaeological Section (ancient venetian, Magna Graecia, Roman and medieval finds), in the Picture Gallery (paintings from the 13th to the 20th century) and in the cloister (lapidary: stones, badges, inscriptions, headstones and architectural fragments from the 13th century).<br />
	In the Picture Gallery 500 paintings are displayed, and among those there is the largest collection in the world of Jacopo da Ponte&rsquo;s works and many examples of the activity of his &rdquo;bottega&ldquo;. In the Canova&rsquo;s section over two thousand signed drawings are collected, along with his correspondence, his library, several sketches and plaster models and the precious collection of the monochromes, the only evidence of this particular production. In 1943 the Civic Library opened after Brocchi&rsquo;s inheritance, and during the years there have been several other donations: Bassano leaflets by Giambattista Roberti, original manuscripts by Bartolomeo Gamba, Antonio Canova&rsquo;s correspondence, drawing albums and books of engravings, a part of the library and of the papers of the Remondini printers.<br />
	The library hosts also the Town Archive with documents from 1211 to 1950.<br />

	The Ceramic Museum from 1992 is located inside the Sturm Palace, a beautiful 16th century house that welcomes the visitors with a ionic pronaos and a hall of honor frescoed in 1765 by Giorgio Anselmi. The thick stucco decoration that adorns some rooms can be considered one of the most important Rococo decorations in Veneto. The collection of pottery, porcelain and pottery pieces (about 1200 pieces) is displayed chronologically: from the medieval pottery to the Manardi&rsquo;s maiolica (17th - 18th century); the most important evidence is the Antonibon family&rsquo;s production (18th - 19th century). The large veranda offers an appropriate space for eclectic ceramic, while in the old kitchen popular plates are displayed and in the lower floor there are several works from many famous international artists.

The exhibition suggests the theme of a travel along a timeline that links the Remondini family&rsquo;s history with their works; a path that covers 200 years of human history and of European culture, between the second half of the 15th century and the first half of the 19th century.</p>

	The Civic Tower dominates Garibaldi Square with its mass. It was probably built in the middle of the 13th century (from the da Romano family) but the most likely date is 1312 when, during the extension of the second curtain wall, it became a strategic defensive and protection point for the new part of the town that was expanding beyond the walls. The tower really stood out for the height, width and depth of its walls, for the massive truncated pyramid base and for the lack of decoration. In the town documents it first appears when a bell of 500 kilograms is placed at its top.<br />
	From this moment the tower was owned by the Municipality which was responsible for the maintenance and the payment of the guardians. The guardians held several duties but the most important one was the vedette from the top of the tower in order to shout riots, disasters or assault threats.</p>
<p>
	The actual name &quot;Civic Tower&quot; was given when, in 1494, at its base a stone door with the town coat-of-arms painted on it was created. In 1625 a hole was created above the door to give light to the keeper&rsquo;s house and a wooden stair was built to create a connection with the ground; in 1727 the original steps were partly replaced with stone ones. It is not known the year in which the coat-of-arms of Venice was fresco painted as an honorary title. During the 18th century a clock was added to the tower and during the 19th century the jagged edges were built. The tower certainly stands out if compared to all the other historical buildings in the town centre: for its central position inside the urban layout and because it dominates the entire town with its height (43 meters). After a recent massive restoration it has been reopened to the public.&nbsp;<br />

	Fossils, rocks and minerals tell us geographic and environmental changes of the territory of Agno Valley,&nbsp; showing step by step the evolution of animals and vegetables that lived in those places: reptiles forbears of dinosaurs, snails, shells, see urchins, corals, sponges and different species of vegetables. The places, in the beginning inhospitality and dry, then were covered by see environments more or less deep until it became quiet lagoons with tropical climate.<br />
	The museum offers a tactile journey along all the exhibit space of section dedicated to geology and palaeontology, with inscriptions both big characters and Braille system. There are also available short guide books both big characters and Braille system.<br />
	The archaeological section collects and shows to advantage the specimens, which explain the long human presence in the High Agno Valley, constantly from ancient to medieval time. Festari Palace, in which Museum is located, has a little garden near a museum entrance; in this space several materials about geological history of the Agno Valley find place. In particular two woody reconstructions of &quot;Saurian&quot; catch the attention of the visitors: Velociraptor and Pteranodon, a flying reptile. They are surrounded by fossils specimens coming from all over the valley and by typical rocks of local layers. In the garden there are also two vegetables species called living fossils because they settled Earth for a period of over 200 million years and they survived in time without being subjected at any kind of adjustment. The stratigraphic pyramid lets visitors have e general and immediate picture of the plenty of valley, observing directly all the outcrops from Recoaro (Vicenza, Italy) to Montecchio Maggiore (Vicenza, Italy); at the end there is a panel which helps to find the most important geological and archaeological sites of Agno Valley. The D. Dal Lago Museum is part of Rete Museale Alto Vicentino.&nbsp;<br />

The overall complex is closely tied to the history and the civic, moral and cultural of the city and district. Its collections provide interesting evidence of local and national events from the first Napoleonic campaign in Italy in 1796 to the historic events of the World War II and the fight for liberation. The very interesting Fantoni, Cariolato and Radovich collections are considered to be among the best of the Risorgimento in Italy.</p>"

	The Museo Diocesano of Vicenza was created in 2005 to hold some of the most precious and significant artworks of the historical, artistic and cultural path of the Church of Vicenza. The museum is located in the vast premises of the episcopal palace whose origin dates back to the end of the 12th century; subsequently enlarged and reshaped, it owes its present appearance to the significant interventions carried out in the 19th century and in the post-World War 2 period. One of the remaining 15th-16th century additions, located in the northern wing facing the inner garden, is the exquisite Loggia Zeno, a refined Renaissance work incorporated in the pre-existent Gothic building in 1494.</p>
<p>
	From the ground floor, visitors can access the basement which houses some donations -including a curious collection of minerals worked into a spherical shape- and where a few ancient findings can be seen, such as a Roman drainpipe and the foundations of an early medieval tower. The first floor, characterized by the presence of the large episcopal hall, a portion of which is reserved for temporary exhibitions, holds a remarkable collection of sacred jewellery and four rooms devoted to modern painting.

floors. The complex has two warehouses, one connected to the section 
where wine was made and the other where grain was stored. After a period
 of decline which coincided with the time of the departure of the 
military fleet, the villa was partially reoccupied by the imperial court
 when they transferred to Ravenna, which became the capital in 401 AD. 
The villa was then definitively abandoned in the early Middle Ages and 
already at the end seventh century, the area resembled a wasteland.</div><p align=""justify"">&nbsp;</p>"

5085,20038,traduzioni_descrizione,en,"The remains of Ancient Ostia stand on a territorial and geographical context that is very different from the ancient one: in fact, in the Roman age, the Tiber skirted the northern side of the inhabited area, while nowadays it scarcely touches a portion of the western sector, having had its bed dragged downstream by a famous and disastrous flood in 1557.<br>Moreover, the shoreline as well, originally close to the town, is now 4 km away from it, because of the advance of the mainland due to the debris left by the river over the last 2000 years. Ostia, therefore, was a town built on both the sea and the river and such a special position determined its relevance over the centuries from a strategic-military and an economic viewpoint.<br>According to an ancient tradition, it was founded as a colony by the fourth king of Rome, Ancus Marcius, about the year 620 BCE, in order to exploit the salt-mines at the mouth of the Tiber (hence the name Ostia, which derives from ostium = embouchure). Nevertheless, the most ancient remain is a fortalice (Castrum), made of tufa blocks, dating only to the second half of the 4th c. BCE, built by the Roman settlers with the solely military aim of controlling the mouth of the Tiber and the Latian coast.<br>Later, especially after the 2nd century BCE, when Rome gained supremacy over the whole Mediterranean sea, the military function of the town started to decrease, as it quickly became the main emporium of Rome. For this reason, particularly between the 1st and the 2nd century CE, Ostia greatly expanded by equipping itself with prominent public and private buildings.<br>In the following centuries, given the general decline of the Roman Empire, the town fell into a slow decay which led to the abandonment of the site after the mid-5th century CE."

5130,106564,traduzioni_descrizione,en,"The buildings along the north side of Piazza Labus are the result of a long series of changes and adaptations of the buildings that between theMiddle Ages and the 18th century were put up against the ruins of the Roman Basilica. Still today you can clearly see in the fronts of the buildings parts of the southern façade of the big public complex planned in the Flavian age to close off the Forum, to which it constituted a sort of monumental entry. The building, destined for the mostimportant civil activities of the community, was surrounded by porticos that were joined to those of the Forum and was frontally contrasted with the sanctuary situated to the north, on the slopes of the Cydnean Hill; it was connected to it by numerous stylistic affinities, like the architectural decorations and the floor decorations. The front presented a harmonic system of apertures, three portals andtwelve windows, between Corinthian responds on Attic bases. The capitals, among the very few to be seen in situ in Brescia with those of the Capitolium and the Forum, are formed by two crowns of acanthus leaves, and support a lintel with various decreasing and protruding bands, with decoration with plants, astragals and beads also found on the frieze over the doors and the frames. The inside floor of the single big rectangular room, deprived of peristasis, was in opus sectile with slabs in white and grey marble set out in a reticular scheme and in big squares; there was a similar scheme for the floor of the external portico, characterized, however, by a tauter module with the colours in an inverted sequence. The wall linings, in contrast with the solemn chromatic sobriety of the floors, were lively compositions of polychrome slabs of Greek and Asian marbles: on this background there stood out the statues, the tables, the fountains and the honorary inscriptions. The Basilica of Brixia belongs to a transition typology between the most ancient open types and the later closed ones, original for the façade with a portico, for the vast brightness of the interior, and for the character of a big covered gallery that must have distinguished it. Inside the archaeological area, which you entered via streetnumber 3, through the office of the Lombardy Superintendence for the Archaeological Heritage, you can see significant parts of the ancient Flavian building and the older layout of the piazza in the Julian-Claudian age, as well as walls from the medieval epoch that in the foundations and in the elevations reused architectural elements from the Roman monument; there are also various materialscoming from excavation of the site, including a big honorary base with a dedication to Nonius Macrinus and other finds from various epochs, from prehistory to the nineteenth century."

at the end of the 8th or the 7th century BC (it depends on different
interpretations) on the charming promontory of Capo di Pula, between sea and
pools. In the ancient Phoenician, Punic and then Roman trade centre we can see
the Phoenician necropolis, the inhabited centre and the Punic <em>tophet</em>. A
beautiful theatre (beginning of the 1st century BC), one of the best preserved
buildings of Nora, rises among the ancient paved streets. Imposing are the
thermal baths, often decorated with splendid mosaics that date back to the 2nd-
4th century AD. Important religious buildings are the Punic temple of Tanit, in
the homonymous hill, temple n.6 and the sanctuary of Aesculapius (2nd-3rd
century AD). Many private buildings, often with water tank and built with <em style=""mso-bidi-font-style:normal"">opus caementicium</em> and <em style=""mso-bidi-font-style:normal"">africanum</em>, are often particularly
prestigious, as the house with tetrastyle atrium and mosaics dating from the

honorary statues of famous people. After a long period that started in the 5th
century AD, the city was definitely abandoned in the 8th century because of
pirate and Vandal raids. From the end of 1800 the city was brought to light by
the researches of Nissardi and Vivanet and then by the excavations in 1952.

Su Nuraxi is one of the most important archaeological complexes of Sardinia,
both for its extent and the complexity of its structure. The settlement was
built in different stages from the 16th to the 6th century BC. The core is a
central embattled tower (mastio) englobed in a quadrilobed rampart, which is in
a barbican fortified by five towers. The central tower has three superimposed
chambers with <em style=""mso-bidi-font-style:normal"">tholos </em><span style=""mso-bidi-font-style:italic"">vault</span>, built of mighty basalt blocks
of different size, bigger in the base and gradually smaller to the top. In the
big central courtyard, a circular well covered with rough stones was probably
used as water reserve and to keep stores of food in a cool place. The large
area delimited by the defensive wall held the villagers during the sieges. All
around, in about one and a half hectare, are the ruins of a big village with
more than 200 habitations gradually erected from the 12th to the 6th century BC.
In the mid-7th century BC the great bulwark of Barumini was overcome by the
expansion of some native potentates, as other important Nuragic settlements of
the island. The Sardinians rebuilt a new village around the nuraghe, using the
structure for human habitation until the period of Imperial Rome (3rd century
AD). The site was rediscovered by Giovanni Lilliu between 1949 and 1955. This
archaeological site is one of the most visited and appreciated in Sardinia, and
since 2000 it has been a Unesco World Heritage site. On the top of the central
tower you enjoy a delightful view on the extent of the village, its huts and
narrow alleys. </span></p>

<p class=""MsoBodyText""><span style=""mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"" lang=""EN-GB"">The
archaeological complex rises on a basalt plateau dominating the gulf of Orosei
and consists of a nuraghe and a village. The nuraghe Mannu (literally %u201Dbig%u201D),
dating from the 14th century BC, is slightly small and was probably named after
the wide surrounding village. It is a single tower nuraghe (5m high) built of
trachyte and local basalt. The east facing entrance, typical of nuraghi, is to
take advantage of sunlight. After a short corridor covered with large flat
slabs (plat band), a central chamber with spiral staircase led to the higher
level. Now there are few remains of this structure. This site is important for
the presence of a village with more than 200 huts, one of the widest in the
island and partially brought to light. In the village, a settlement of about
1000 people, the huts differed in size and shape. It dates back to the 3rd
millennium BC, as the ceramics from Vaso Campaniforme Culture attest, but it
was frequented until the Imperial Roman Age (5th century AD). </span></p>

central- north Sardinia in the Marghine region, is one of the most impressive
Nuragic settlements in the island. It consists of three giants%u2019 graves, a

intact large exedra, with the entrance to the burial chamber in the middle through
a pierced trapezoidal slab. A bench with 27 blocks is along the exedra. Near
the exedra and around the tomb, many variously shaped ashlars are still
visible. Six cone- shaped baethyles are on the left side of the tomb. The three
biggest baethyles represent female figures with breasts, while the others are
completely smooth and symbolize the male phallus. These particular ogival-
shaped stones have often a religious function: they represent divinities who
give life and bring back to life. It is a complex nuraghe, with round central

of different cultures%u2019 superimposition from the Punic age to the early Middle
Ages. The first evidences in this area date back to the Nuragic period
(1500-1200 BC), but the city of Tharros was founded at the end of the 8th
century BC by Phoenician colonists maybe coming from the city of Sidon. The
most important areas are the necropolis and the small temple of Capo San Marco,
the necropolis of San Giovanni di Sinis and the Phoenician <em>tofet</em> Su
Murru Mannu. Recently also the ancient Phoenician- Punic port was brought to
light, south of the western side of the Mistras pond. From the end of the 6th
century to 238 BC, Tharros became the object of territorial and trade interests
of Carthage thanks to its strategic position. In that period the city suffered
many transformations. The remains of the great wall on the high ground Su Murru
Mannu, the rich south and north necropolises, the Punic <em>tofet</em>, temples
with Doric semi- columns and the distyle temple (restored during the Roman-
Republican period) date back to this age. In 238-237 BC, Tharros was conquered
by the Romans. The slow but progressive Romanization of the city is testified
by the northern wall and the distyle temple on the Colle di San Giovanni. The
most important evidences date back to the Imperial period (1st century BC- 4th
century AD): thermal baths, the remains of a small amphitheatre, an important
road and sewage system, the aqueduct, the <em>castellum aquae</em>, the forum and
several temples. Among the few remains from the early Middle Ages, worth
mentioning is a baptismal basin dating back to the 5th- 6th century. Tharros,
the first capital city of the Giudicato d%u2019Arborea, was abandoned in 1070.</span><span style=""mso-ansi-language:EN-GB;mso-fareast-language:EN-US"" lang=""EN-GB""></span></p>

dedicated to Christ the Saviour in the homonymous village, an important
pilgrimage centre. Frequented from the Middle Neolithic age (4th millennium
BC), this site has been considered a sacred place by
different cultures over the centuries. A sacred well for water cult was dug in
the Nuragic age; in the Punic age this area was dedicated to Sid, the healing
god, and afterwards the Romans adopted the cult of Asklepius, attributing
healing powers to water. Since the 3rd- 4th century AD the hypogeum has been
used as a church. The present site dates back to the last Roman period: the
plan, with several small rooms, is centred around a spring water well, set in a
round domed room with a skylight on the top. In front of it, an apsed room with
two skylights keeps another spring water well and a Nuragic baethyl (sacred
stone). In almost every wall, Punic, Greek, Latin and Arab inscriptions are
still visible together with paintings dating back to different periods, related to

sharpening stones, flint
and obsidian splinters, askoidi vases (with pitcher shape), pans,
spindles and loom weights, it is supposed that the huts were used not only for
human habitation, but also for foodstuffs and different activities as wool
weaving, cereals grinding and vases baking. This area was probably a cult
place. 

The complex dates back to the Early/First Iron

&#13;
The ancient Roman Theater is in the municipality of Gubbio, in the archaeological area called Della Guastuglia; it corresponds to the vast late-republican district of the 2nd-1st century B.C., which extends over the flat country right outside the city entrance of Porta degli Ortacci and includes the area between Via Matteotti, Via Perugina, Via Ubaldi and Via Parruccini. The visit itinerary to the remnants of the Teatro Romano and the archaeological finds kept in the Antiquarium constitute a precious opportunity to learn about the social organization of the Roman town of Iguvium—Gubbio—from the recreational to the residential areas revealing the tastes, tradition and customs of the time.&#13;
The Theater, accomplished with the contribution of the town’s magistrate Gneus Satrius Rufus around 20 B.C., was built with large rusticated blocks of limestone. It has two orders of arcades, of which the lower arcade and some arches of the upper arcade still remain standing. Remnants of some Opus Reticolatum—brickwork used in exterior walls typical of the ancient Roman architecture—are in the corridors and the vomitoires. The cavea is subdivided into four wedges and the strips without steps, probably, hosted wooden stairs. The floor of the orchestra, paved with slabs of limestone, allowed for the drainage of rainwater into a large cistern positioned underneath, called the pulpitum. The frons scaenaes has two lateral rectangular niches and a central semicircular niche. The theater’s edifice could hold up to six thousand spectators and was among the largest of the times."

The Ipogeo di San Manno is in the locality of Ferro di Cavallo, at a short distance from Perugia.&#13;
It is in a medieval house, property of the Knights of Malta. The hypogeum consists of a large rectangular room with a vaulted ceiling and is completely faced with a layer of travertine slabs, perfectly aligned and joined together “a secco”, i.e. without the use of mortar. On the longer sides, two small squared chambers open—symmetrically—one to the left and one to the right of the room, and both have a vaulted ceiling. Above the arch of access in the left chamber, a three line long Etruscan inscription—each of different length—has been sculpted. The text mentions the tomb built by Aule and Larth of the Precu family, and the father Larth and the mother, from the Cestna family, are commemorated."

&#13;
In July 2005, the remains of a monumental complex of large dimensions were found just right outside Spoleto’s walls. Further archaeological investigations have led to the identification of seven rooms, probably part of the central body of a Roman Villa or of a public building in the Late Imperial Age.&#13;
The first room preserves almost completely intact its three-color—white, pink and black—Mosaic Floor with a geometrical pattern. In the second room the polychrome mosaic floor is still preserved along with remnants of the frescoed walls. The decoration of the almost 140 square meters of mosaic floor presents oval patterns called “cushions” reproducing zoomorphic and anthropomorphous figures. Wild animal figures, such as panthers, deer, wild boar and ducks etc. and of fantasy are represented inside the ovals.&#13;
At the center of the room, a scene with two nude human male figures—by profile—pouring wine is placed. The character on the left holds an amphora on his shoulders, from which he pours wine into a small cup, held by the character to the right; the abundant wine spilling out of the cup is collected inside a large krater vase left on the floor. The other symmetrically disposed characters, always depicted with the black tesserae, hold on to hand foliages or elements attributed to the world of agriculture, probably depicting the four seasons.&#13;
A third room has a geometric mosaic floor with larger tesserae. It is most probable that this was the peristyle, from which the entire length—24,50meters by 5 meters—is known.&#13;
The fluidity of the design and the chromatic choices, in particular in the larger room, testify the high technique of the workshop, whose labor force could have come from Rome to satisfy the requests of a particularly wealthy client coming from specific social strata. The Villa can be dated to the early 4th century A.D., date which the materials found on the excavation site also seem to indicate."
5279,108083,traduzioni_descrizione,en,"Archeological Area of Scoppieto&#13;
&#13;
The site of the Area Archeologica extending to Scoppieto, under the municipality of Baschi, occupies the&#13;
plain dominating the Tiber Valley, in an area rich with clay deposits, water and fertile land.&#13;
The visit to the archaeological excavation site represents a point of departure, but also a point of arrival, of an archaeological and naturalistic itinerary that runs through Tiber River Park, which offers a panoramic view&#13;
of the ancient settlements, built along the river, that served as an agile means of communication and transportation. The tour is essentially completed with the visit to the Municipal Antiquarium of Baschi, where the materials found in the archaeological area are displayed.&#13;
The investigations, which have been carried out by the University of Perugia since 1995, brought a 4 century B.C. Sanctuary to light, which was transformed—from the 1 century B.C.—into a ceramic manufacturing complex. Once this activity ended, the area was transformed into a residential neighborhood until the 4 century A.D. The workshop remained in function for almost a century and produced earthenware pottery, known as terra sigillata—sealed earth—that was named from the sigillum, which was stamped on&#13;
the matrix used to impress the decorative motives of the vases.&#13;
Apart from the calyx, cups, plates and bowls that typically had polished surfaces with a coral red color, bricks and lamps were also produced. The invariably aligned potter workspaces, which stood near a water basin to&#13;
keep the clay, the potter wheel and the brazier, have re-emerged in the area of 2000 square meters that has been discovered up to now. The other phases of the manufacturing, from the depuration of the clay to the&#13;
firing of the final product in the kiln are on the site. The signature of the Scoppieto potters applied on the ceramics shows us the network of the distribution of the goods, which was widespread and on a large scale&#13;
in the entire Mediterranean basin and passed through the extremely close and economical Tiber River."

&#13;
The Necropoli del Crocefisso del Tufo—its name comes from a crucifix incision on the tuff rock—extends all along the northern tuff rock slope, upon which the ancient Etruscan Velzna—Orvieto—stands.&#13;
Discovered in the 19th century, it represents an extraordinary evidence of Etruscan history and culture.&#13;
Visiting this site is essential and complementary to the visits to The National Archeological Museum and the Claudio Faina Museum of Orvieto, which preserves a great number of finds, above all the rich ceramic goods.&#13;
The Necropolis was attended from the 8th to the 3rd centuries B.C. The layout of the necropolis, planning it into lots—i.e. grouped into blocks—dates back to the apex of its development during the 6th and 5th centuries B.C. The lots, defined by orthogonal intersecting roads that were occupied by tombs of the cubic kind—“a&#13;
dado” like dice—follow a rigid disposition reflecting a social organization of an egalitarian kind. Every burial was reserved for a single family, identified by the inscriptions—the name sculpted on the entrance lintels—that reveal the presence of foreigners in Orvieto, a town that was growing more and more cosmopolite.&#13;
Some forms of ostentation of wealth achieved by a large strata of the population are expressed with the luxurious items contained in the funerary goods, acquired on Eastern Greek markets, many of which are displayed inside the National Archaeological Museum and in the Claudio Faina Museum of Orvieto."

The Parco Archeologico di Otricoli is what remains of the Roman town of Ocriculum, which rose on the sides of a deviation from Via Flaminia that was connected with an important River Port, the so-called “Oil Port”, located along a deep curve of the Tiber River that has since disappeared. The port, active at least up to the 15th century, is today part of an itinerary binding the ancient town to the medieval center, standing at a distance of 2kilometers to the northeast of the Roman settlement. The itinerary pathway starts from the Antiquarium of San Fulgenzio, documentation center of all the archaeological area and center for the conservation of the finds coming from the most recent excavation sites. This is an open-air space of approximately 36 hectares, with the main public edifices and funerary monuments of the Roman settlement still visible. They are concentrated at the entrance into town from the Flaminian Way: see the fountain and funerary monuments; at the center of the urban area, see the Octagonal Hall with the Mosaic of the Thermal Complex, the large substructures and the Theater; at the far-southern end, the Amphitheater."

&#13;
The Parco Archeologico di Carsulae includes the ruins of the Roman Municipium— town in Latin—of Carsulae, which sprang up on the sides of the ancient road Via Flaminia, near the small town of San Gemini, a locality that has been well known for its mineral water springs since antiquity.&#13;
In this rich and active old center, designed during the Augustan ages, the remnants of the main public, civil and religious monuments are still visible: the Curia and the Gemini Temples—overlooking the Forum—the Basilica, the Theater and the Amphitheater. The latter is positioned along the Via Flaminia, which entered into the town through the monumental Arch of San Damiano. The Via Flaminia urban stretch constituted the “Cardo Maximus”—main axis, from north to south, in Latin. It was paved with large blocks of stone called basoli and had edge-stones on the sides functioning as sidewalks and gutters to drain water. Funerary monuments are still visible to the north of the Arch of San Damiano, while on the opposite side there are Thermal Bath facilities, where the work of excavation has not been completed yet. The water supply was provided through some Cisterns, one of them—after having had several different functions—has been transformed into a Antiquarium, and destined to house the display of the architectural fragments and frescoed detached plaster and architectural terracotta, as well as a series of sculptures for a funerary destination. The medieval Church of Santi Cosma e Damiano, built on a pre-existing Roman edifice along the Via Flaminia, testifies to the spreading of Christianity. This construction has been used as a depot of archaeological materials for a long time, and in recent times has been recovered and transformed into a display structure."

Located behind the Cathedral and on the edge between the two parts of the old town, the Roman settlement and the Medieval township, the palace was founded by the military leader and lord of Vasto Giacomo Caldora, probably in the Twenties of the fifteenth century. Not much remains of the original aspect: the overall plan, centered on a wide central yard and few traces of the external walls. Nevertheless the extant mullioned window with two lights and the remains of the portal attest fairly well the elegance of the architectural and decorative arrays. When the Guevara family ascended the power in the town, they probably completed the construction of the palace, especially on the side facing the sea. In 1496 the town fell into the hand of the D'Avalos, who used the palace for more than three centuries as their residence and made of it the seat of the town authorities. In 1566 the Turks invaded Vasto, sacked the town and damaged the palace, taking advantage of the absence of the Marquis Francesco Ferdinando, who had moved to Palermo after being appointed as viceroy of Sicily. His wife, Isabella Gonzaga, daughter of the Duke of Mantova, after her husband's death, ordered the reinforcement and reconstruction of the building, which started in 1573 and did not end before the beginning of the following century. Nonetheless the golden age of the palace was the eighteenth century. The new owners, the family Lante della Rovere, enriched the rooms and made of the palace the seat of a little but lively court. At the time of the French invasion, a period of decay started for the fortress and during the nineteenth century some rooms were demolished or employed for different uses. As from the Sixties of the twentieth century a gradual revival began for D'Avalos Palace, which is today the seat archaeological and art cllections.

          Grosio Rock Engraving Park was created in 1978 in order to develop the rich archaeological, architectural and natural heritage of the ""Dosso dei Castelli"" area, after the donation of the land and medieval ruins by Marquis M. Pallavicino Mossi Visconti Venosta. 
Imponent and silent, the walls of Castello Vecchio di San Faustino (10th - 11th century), with associated church, and of the Visconti's Castello Nuovo (14th century) dominate the hill, which stands at the junction between the river Adda and the stream Roasco, at the beginning of Val Grosina. Nearby rises Rupe Magna, a large rock shaped like a whale's back, which bears more than 5000 engravings (4th - 1st millennium BC). 
The Cà del Cap Museum houses an exhibition illustrating the results of archaeological excavations conducted on Dosso dei Castelli and Dosso Giroldo, which were both occupied by Bronze and Iron Age settlements (16th - 2nd/1st century BC).
The park is managed by a consortium of local authorities (Sondrio Provincial Authority, Tirano Mountain Community, Grosio and Grosotto Councils) in close collaboration with the Lombardy Archaeological Superintendency's research and conservation programmes.

In the Valley of the Temples, declared UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1997, there is one of the main archaeological complexes of the Mediterranean, immersed in a rural landscape of rare beauty characterized by the presence of century-old olive and almond trees. Akragas was one of the most important Greek colonies in Sicily. It extended over an area of 450 hectares and was founded around 582 B.C. by colonists from the nearby town of Gela and from Rhodes.<br>&nbsp;The site chosen for the foundation was a plateau, protected to the north by the Rupe Atenea and by the hill of Girgenti and to the south by the long Collina dei Templi ('Hill of the Temples') and bordered by the Akragas and the Hypsas rivers, which converge into a single stream towards the sea. The ancient port (emporion) was at the mouth of this river. The city took its name from the river Akragas, rich in crabs. Ever since its beginnings -under the tirrany of Phalaris (570-554 B.C.), famous for his cruelty- the city developed in terraces and had a regular urban plan. The acropolis was on the Rupe Atenea and had both a sacred and a defensive function. The monumental sanctuaries were on the Collina dei Templi. The area in the middle was occupied by houses and public buildings, while the dead were buried in the necropoleis, outside the city walls. In the last decades of the 6th century B.C., a massive defensive wall, twelve kilometers long and with nine gates, was built around Akragas. This colony became famous and powerful under the tyrant Theron (488-471 B.C.) who defeated the Carthaginians in the Battle of Himera (480 B.C.) and, even more, during the period of the democracy (471-406 B.C.), instituted by the akragantine philosopher Empedocles.<br>The magnificent series of Doric temples on the southern hill of Agrigento was built during this period. A second conflict with the Carthaginians marked the end of a flourishing period and in 406 B.C. Akragas was destroyed. Later the city lived another phase of development with the arrival, between 338 and 334 B.C., of Greek colonists guided by the general Timoleon, although it never regained its past splendour and its fate was dependent on the outcome of the conflict between Rome and Carthage for the rule of the Mediterranean. During the Punic wars, Akragas was the base of the Carthaginians, but in 210 B.C. the Romans conquered it and changed its name to Agrigentum. Under Roman rule, the city lived another phase of prosperity connected to the sulphur trade (2nd to 4th centuries A.D.). During Christian times churches and cemeteries were built on the Collina dei Templi. When in 829 the Arabs conquered the city, the residential quarters had already been moved up to where modern-day Agrigento is, on the hill of Girgenti, so-called from the Medieval name of the city (from the Arab Gergent or Kerkent)."

The Bosco di San Francesco in Assisi is a splendid example of rural Italian landscape, which has 64 hectares and more than 800 years of history. It represents a real and true interior journey to discover the message of the perfect harmony between Man and the Creation that St Francis taught to the world. Visitors can cover the distance of the narrow path that, departing from the San Francesco Basilica and passing the Selva di San Francesco—owned by the Papal Basilica, Sacro Convento di San Francesco d’Assisi—goes through woodlands and cultivated fields, and crosses glades and olive tree groves. Upon arriving at the bottom of the valley, the evidence of a microcosm inhabited between the 13th and 14th century by Benedictine nuns can be discovered. It includes a church, a mill, the remnants of a hospice and a monastery and, further on, an ancient tower-factory, from which it is possible to admire the work of Michelangelo Pistoletto, titled Terzo Paradiso—Third Paradise—an extraordinary example of Land Art.&#13;

Risen, according to the tradition, over a temple consecrated to Janus, the church dates back as a minimum to the fifth century. Often adjusted and re-built over the centuries, especially after the Norman and Turkish raids in 1060 and 1566 respectively, and after earthquakes in 1125 a 1703, the cathedral still keeps the two Gothic portals. The former, built in the thirteenth century and never accomplished, is located on the side of the clock-tower; the latter, partly re-built after 1943, was carried out by the master Nicola Mancino in 1312, as inscribed once on the architrave. The church, formerly consecrated to the Holy Mary, took its present name from the apostle Saint Thomas, whose mortal remains, brought here from Chios on 6 September 1258, are nowadays preserved in a seventeenth-century guilt-silver case, adorned with an image of the saint depicted by the artist from Ortona Tommaso Alessandrino.</div>"

5428,110825,traduzioni_descrizione,en,"The Cistercian Abbey of Arabona was most probably founded when, in the year 1197, Gentile and Manerio of Palearia bestowed a donation on the monk Pietro from Sant'Anastasio alle Acque Salvie and on Bartolomeo, procurator of the church of Santa Maria in Monte Vitulo. The golden age of the eleventh and twelfth centuries is followed by years of crisis, which hindered from accomplishing the area. At the end of the sixteenth century a Franciscan community settled in the monastery and remained there until the end of the eighteenth century. Afterwards it passed to the family Zambra from Chieti and in 1968 to the Diocese of Chieti. The building, begun in 1208 and recognizable even now, was interrupted after the construction of the choir, the transept and magnificent capitular hall, a square room whose vault is supported by a central pillar from which the ribs depart. The architectural elements allow to distinguish two building phases, the former under the direction of a French staff, the latter carried out by local labor force. The overall structure, including the presbytery and the rectangular chapels of the transept, according to the Cistercian scheme developed in Fontenay, belongs to the former phase. A warm light penetrates through the rose-window and the mullioned windows of the presbytery and illuminates two thirteenth-century sculpture masterpieces: the stone tabernacle with embossed flowers supported by two pillars and the Easter candle (six meters high), decorated with shrubs and animals and twisting columns. The two frescoes that adorn the choir are attributed to Antonio from Atri, an important painter lived between the second half of the fourteenth century and the early fifteenth century, who trained in the Marches and worked mostly in various town of the Abruzzi, chiefly in Atri's Cathedral."

The only extant evidence of the seventeenth century is the chapel on the right side of the choir, built in 1686, where the ""Holy Face"" was preserved. According to Father Donato from Bomba's account, dated 1640/45, the holy cloth on which an image of Christ's face is impressed (it is thought to be the so called ""Veronica"") arrived in 1506, when a mysterious pilgrim handed it over to Mr. Giacomantoio Leonelli.

According to an old legend two Roman patricians donated to Saint Benedict himself resources for the construction of the religious area; another legend connects the event to Charlemagne's victory over the Longobard army in 781. The king himself would have ordered to build the monastery upon the battlefield. A community of monks had certainly settled in the place around 884, when the abbot Bertario wrote his Memoratorium (records) about Montecassino's properties in the area of Chieti. After an earthquake in 990, which almost razed the monastery to the ground, the abbot Tebaldo, designated in 1007, started a phase of reconstruction and enlargement of the buildings around and of the church, which was embellished with altars and paintings. The renovation continued when Desiderio was elected abbot of Montecassino in1058. San Liberatore's long history is marked by long-lasting disputes about the property of several possessions of the monastery. At the beginning of the nineteenth century the area appears abandoned and its revival began only in 1958-9, when a substantial and questionable restoration were set to bring the church back to its original aspect. &nbsp;The front of the church - the only extant part of the monastery, along with the belfry - is noteworthy for its gabled-façade with three portals interposed attributed to the abbot Desiderio (eleventh century) and to the Angevin age.

situated on the road, via Sant'Isaia, perfectly integrating with the
surrounding urban environment. The interior appearance is sumptuous
and spectacular and it is thanks to the ""modernization"" of
the ornamental details and paintings from the mid-eighteenth century&nbsp;
of Peter Scandellari who was a ""quadraturista"" and artists
Nicola Bertuzzi Taroni and Tertullian. At the same time, there was
also a transformation of the Serliane and of the Oculus in the top
middle part, into large rectangular windows. In 1799, following the
suppression of religious orders who were being sought by the
Napoleonic government, the church of St. Matthias was separated from
the convent, desecrated and reduced to a warehouse. The restoration
started in 1981 and was completed in 1994 under the sole
responsibility of the Ministry of Heritage and Culture, and has
brought to light many stucco and frescoes. These have been entrusted
to the Regional Directorate for Cultural Heritage of the State
Property Agency of Emilia Romagna, and the Church of San Mattia has
become a centre for meetings, exhibitions, conferences on
architecture, urban planning, design, the study of historical
heritage - artistic-landscaping in Emilia-Romagna.

          The museum of the basilica of St Eustorgio is located on the site of the former Dominican convent. From the cloister one can reach the paleochristian cemetery, which contains an interesting collection of epigraphs. Proceeding further we come to the Chapter room and the ancient sacresty and further on to the PORTINARI Chapel, with the frescoes by Vincenzo Foppa ( 1464-68). A collection of paintings present various examples of the Milanese works ranging from Mannerism to Neoclassicism. Some sculptures, the 12th century statue of St Eugene and the 17th century wooden statues of St Dominic and of St Peter the Martyr, complete the historic and artistic scene. The 15th century cabinets in the sacresty contain a collection of ceremonial silver plates, the saints' relics and what remains of the precious ornaments of the basilica. The purpose of the Parish Museum is to take the visitors through the thousand year history of the basilica from its very origins on an ancient necropolis to the triumph of Renaissance and the various restorations which took place in the 18th and 19th century.
The rich historic and spiritual patrimony of the convent and the basilica are inseparable from a close relationship with the parish community. The Portinari Chapel is not only a sublime work of art but is also a place of worship where the holy mass is celebrated.

mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"" lang=""EN-GB"">Dedicated to the patron saint of Cagliari, the
Basilica di San Saturno is in the area of the most ancient Christian necropolis
of Cagliari, one of the most important early Christian complexes in Sardinia.
The building dates back to the 5th-6th century AD, and perhaps it was built on
the sepulchre of San Saturno, martyred in 304. The original building had a
Greek cross plan with hemispherical dome at the crossing. Now only the central
structure and part of the apse are left. In 1089 the judge of Cagliari
Costantino Salusio II de Lacon- Gunale gave the basilica to the Vittorini monks
from Marseille. The monks restructured it with typical early Romanesque shapes
and it became residence of the Sardinian priorate of the Order. After the
damages during the 14th century, the basilica became property of the
Archdiocese of Cagliari in the mid-15th century. The famous archaeological
excavations that started in 1614 searching for the %u201Choly bodies%u201D, the relics of
saints, brought to light several graves. At the end of the same century the
basilica was partly dismantled and materials reused in the Baroque rebuilding
of the cathedral. It was often restored in the 20th century, while the area of the
necropolis is still being excavated. </span><span style=""font-family:

5574,100679,traduzioni_descrizione,en,"After the death of St Francis in 1226 and following his canonization, Pope Gregory IX laid down a foundation stone on the land where a “specialis ecclesia”—a special church—would be raised. Dedicated to St Francis, the Basilica of San Francesco was consecrated in 1253 by Pope Innocent IV. There are two bodies of construction—the lower church “inferiore” and the upper church “superiore”—built one on top of the other. The two churches correspond respectively to two different construction phases, in which elements of the Umbrian Romanesque and a language influenced by the French Gothic collimate. Its construction was initiated in July 1228 and terminated in 1230, when the body of the Saint was translated there. The double church plan emphasizes the dual function it had to accomplish, the lower church was destined to be the crypt and the upper church was destined to be the monastic lecture hall for preaching. The two churches decorative apparatus represents the most important painting complex of art from the 13th and 14th centuries, in fact, among the eminences of the Italian artists of this period who worked on it there are names such as Cimabue, Giotto, Simone Martini, Pietro Lorenzetti, Jacopo Torriti and others.&#13;
The façade of the upper church, the Basilica superiore of San Francesco, is characterized by its simple lines, and is crowned by a triangular tympanum, in line with the local Gothic taste of the time. The portal is geminated, and at the center of the median portion of the façade there is a Cosmatesque rose window alongside relief sculptures, symbols of the Four Evangelists. On the left side there is a Blessing Tower with its Loggia, which was built in 1607.&#13;
For the lower church, the Basilica inferiore: the access is through a Portal built around the second half of the 1200s; while the interior has an Egyptian cross shaped floor plan with a semicircular apse and a short barrel-vaulted transept. The nave, formed by four bays of surbased-cross vaults—i.e. vaults with a diminished arch rise—is simple. On the lateral sides of each bay, pointed arches open the way to the lateral chapels on their longer sides towards the transept.&#13;
Frescoes from the Master of St. Francis: executed in 1253 approx. and of remarkable iconographic interest, are ascribed to the Master of St. Francis, an anonymous painter of Umbrian origins influenced by the personality of Giunta da Pisano. To the right, Stories of the life of Christ: The Preparation of the Cross, The Crucifixion, Descending from the Cross, The Deposition, Lamentations over the Dead Christ, Appearance of Christ in Emmaus, Madonna with Child and Angel. To the left, Stories of the life of St Francis: Renunciation of his Worldly Goods, Innocent III in a dream sees St Francis holding the Lateran, The Saint Preaching to the Birds, Receiving the Stigmata, The Death of the Saint.&#13;
The lateral Chapels, to the right: &#13;
I. Chapel of SS Louis of Toulouse and Stephen: with frescoes by the painters Dono Doni and Giorgetti and a quadrifora—a four lancet stained glass window—work of Giovanni di Bonino and a co-worker. In the passageway towards the next chapel—dedicated to St Lawrence—there are frescoes of the late 14th century;&#13;
II. Chapel of St Anthony of Padua: with frescoes by Cesare Sermei and a quadrifora, a joint work of some masters, followers of Giotto, and of Giovanni di Bonino;&#13;
III. Chapel of Mary Magdalene: on the right, frescoes executed by Giotto and his collaborators. In the presbytery, the main altar stone is a work of Roman marblers. In the four walls of the ribbed cross vaults the frescoes depicting the Allegories of the Franciscan Virtues and The Glory of St Francis can be dated within the first twenty years of the 1300s.&#13;
The right arm of the cross-vault is divided into two fresco decoration stripes painted by Giotto’s collaborators under his direction; in the first frieze to the right there is a Cimabue work, Enthroned Madonna with Child, four Angels and St Francis and other frescoes; in the second frieze to the right there is the Crucifixion, a work of Giotto, and other frescoes.&#13;
St Nicholas Chapel: with Giotto’s disciples’ frescoes. The left arm of the cross-vault is entirely decorated with frescoes executed between 1315 and 1320 by Pietro Lorenzetti and his helpers: St Francis Receiving the Stigmata, The Capture of Christ, The Last Supper, The Flagellation, The Hanging of Judas, The Washing of the Feet, Entrance in Jerusalem and The Road to Suffering. On the left side, there is the Crucifixion, and below, to the right, The Madonna with Child and SS Francis and Johan the Baptist. &#13;
St Johan the Baptist Chapel: with a fresco of Pietro Lorenzetti depicting a Madonna with Child and SS Francis and Johan the Baptist, with Romanesque and Cimabue influences, and a bifora—a double lancet window. Above the tribune, inside the niche, there is The Crowning of Maria and on the side The Miracle of St Stanislaus and Martyrdom of the Saint ascribed to Puccio Capanna.&#13;
St Martin Chapel was entirely fresco-decorated by Simone Martini, between 1312 and 1320. On the archivolt of the arch at the entrance there are various Saints, and in the rest of the chapel The Stories of the life of St Martin are depicted.&#13;
In the superior church, the Basilica superiore, there is a single four-bay nave, a transept and a polygonal apse, entirely covered by a cross-ogival vaulted ceiling supported by costoloni—ribbed arches—discharging in bundled pillars. The luminosity, inside, is conferred by the presence of bifore and quadrifore—i.e. a series of big double lancet and four lancet windows—both in the nave and in the apse. The architectural solutions adopted come from the Gothic—from the north of the Alps—which finds its faithful application in this church even while maintaining characteristics of the Italian tradition.&#13;
The transept and the apse are entirely decorated with a vast cycle of frescoes executed, starting from 1277, by Cimabue. In the left arm of the cross vault, the Crucifixion is followed by five apocalyptic scenes. The frescoes of the apse depict the Stories of the life of the Virgin Mary. On the right arm of the cross vault the Facts of the Life of St Peter are depicted, a work executed by Cimabue’s closest masters. The frescoes of the cross vault in which The Four Evangelists are depicted are also ascribed to Cimabue. On the vault, at the height of the 3rd bay, there are some frescoes executed by Jacopo Torriti; at the height of the 1st bay there are The Four Doctors of the Church, ascribable to several masters, among whom the Master of Isaac and the Master of the Capture. On the upper walls all along the nave and at the sides of the windows, the frescoes depict the Stories of the Old Testament and the New Testament, ascribed to Jacopo Torriti, to the Master of the Pentecost, to the Master of the Capture and to the Master of Isaac.&#13;
Set in the lower part of the wall of the nave, between the architectural structures of the bays, regrouped in three scenes each partitioned by fake spiral columns, and united by a fake mantelpiece and a ceiling in lacunars, there are the 28 scenes depicting the Stories of the life of St Francis of Giotto and other painters, such as the Master of Isaac, the Master of the Capture, the Master of the Crucifix of Montefalco and the Master of St Cecilia. The cycle is inspired by the Life—Legenda Maior—of Bonaventure from Bagnoregio."

&#13;
The Basilica di Santa Maria degli Angeli was built between 1569 and 1679, its walls enclose the Franciscan Convent structure built behind the Porziuncola—in Latin Portiuncula. Pope Pius V, at the end of the Council of Trent, commissioned the construction of the Basilica, both for the recognition of the importance assumed by the Franciscan minor order and to host the pilgrims that then, and still now, continue to flock there for the occasion of the Indulgence and Pardon—31st July-2 August—desired by St Francis himself.&#13;
The church was completed in 1679 with the construction of the right side tower bell. It has three naves and was designed by the architect Galeazzo Alessi; the building of the church saw the participation of Giacomo Martelli, Giacomo Giorgetti and probably the Vignola.&#13;
Due to the collapses, caused by the 1832 earthquake, the basilica was in part rebuilt, preserving the same forms, by Luigi Poletti (1836-40). The façade was built in 1925-30. In the same 1930, the Madonna degli Angeli statue, realized by the sculptor Colasanti, was collocated on its top, whereas for the intervention on the recent rearrangement of the square to the fore, it was necessary to wait for the design of the architect Nicolosi in 1950. &#13;
At the interior, the three naves have lateral chapels, whose wall decorations represent the most organic collection of the Umbrian paintings of the late 1500s and early 1600s. Of great artistic interest are the Porziuncola Chapel and the Transit Chapel, but above all they are of religious importance because they are bound up with the life of the Saint.&#13;
The Porziuncola Chapel, dating back to the 10th-11th centuries, is dedicated to St Mary of the Angels, also known as Santa Maria della Porziuncola. Around 1025, St Francis established his home there and restored its premises; he founded the Franciscan Order there in 1208. The superior part of the façade is decorated by a fresco of Friedrich Overbeck form Lübeck (1829) depicting St Francis imploring Jesus and the Madonna the Granting of the Indulgence and Pardon. On the right side, fragments of some frescoes of Sienese influence are visible, and they date back to the 15th century. Inside, the altarpiece is made of a large panel painted by Ilario da Viterbo depicting The Annunciation and Stories of the Pardon.&#13;
This chapel, called Cappella del Transito, is the cell of the infirmary where St Francis died on the 3rd of October 1226. The frescoes depicting the Death and Funeral of St Francis painted on the exterior are of the artist Domenico Bruschi (1886). Inside there are frescoes of Giovanni di Pietro, known as lo Spagna. Inside the chapel, there is a niche with a glazed terracotta statue of St Francis of Andrea della Robbia.&#13;
The access to a corridor leading to the Roseto—the rose garden—and the Chapel of the Roses opens from the sacristy. The gardens are part of a legend in the life of St Francis; they were planted exclusively with roses without thorns. Next to the garden is the Chapel (1518), three rooms are decorated with the frescoes of Tiberio d’Assisi, also author of the frescoes in the Oratorio of San Bonaventura (1506). Along the way toward the exit, a 15th century cloister is visible; this is what remains of the small convent from the times of St Bernardino from Siena (15th century)."

&#13;
The church is located in the city center of Montefalco, in the area between the ancient wall surrounding the town and the one built in 1328, in Via Ringhiera Umbra.&#13;
It was built by the Franciscan Friars of the Minor Order, around 1340. It was only later that the six chapels on the right side were added, probably in the late 14th-early 15th century. &#13;
A chapel was opened on the left side of the church, as desired by the Provincial Minister of the Minor Friar, Clemente Bontadosi, around 1585. The chapel has an imposing front elevation, with two lateral Corinthian jamb columns. The entablature, decorated with spirals supporting the tympanum, is framed with a broken triangular pediment. In 1876, the architect Francesco Salviati da Montefalco realized the façade coating and opened the bifora—a double lancet or mullioned window. Further restoration work carried out in 1889 led to the demolition of the Baroque altars and the redoing of the roof trusses.&#13;
In 1863, the church became property of the Municipality of Montefalco, and in 1895 it was adapted as an Art Gallery; the restoration work carried out at the end of the 20th century allowed its reopening to the public.&#13;
The façade, coated with slabs of a light stone, has the shape of a cabin underlined by two lateral lesene pilasters; at the center of the façade an arch frames the portal; it is delimited by two lesenes—featuring two columns with their rosette-molded capital—that stand on a high base under a classical trabeation with triglyph and metope supporting a triangular tympana. Above, there is a bifora opened in 1876. &#13;
The interior of the church shows an initially planned single nave, which ends with a polygonal apse and two squared chapels; on the right side there are six interconnected chapels, while on the left side there is only one. The roof above the nave is wood-trussed, while the chapels are covered by cross vaults, and the apse has a bevel dome. The dome of the apse is supported by rib vaults ending on sculpted corbels with faces of females, a bishop face, a friar face and the head of an eagle and that of a lion; on the central wall of the apse a two order double lancet window provides light for the nave. The vaults of the chapels are also ribbed and the corbels are decorated with sculpted foliage.&#13;
On the nave to the right, there is the first chapel on the first bay. This is St Jerome Chapel, frescoed between 1450 and 1452 by Benozzo Gozzoli. It is the first majestic cycle of frescoes executed autonomously by the Florentine painter, who was thirty at the time, and had been a fellow worker of Beato Angelico for years. On the main wall a fake polyptych depicts a Madonna with Child and the SS Anthony of Padua, Jerome, John the Baptist Louis of Toulouse; above a Crucifixion and Saints and two Episodes of the Life of St Jerome; in the vault the Four Evangelists and other fragmentary scenes of the Life of the Saint. Under the arch, a Blessing Christ with Angels, SS Bernardino of Siena, Catherine of Alexandria, Jerome in the Desert and Sebastian are depicted.&#13;
In the second bay there is St Bernardino Chapel with frescoes of Jacopo Vincioli (1461).&#13;
Under the third bay there is the Chapel of the Crucifix, which preserves a painted and cross shaped Crucifix with the Virgin and St John the Evangelist and on the sides St Francis at the Feet of Christ, work of the Expressionist Master of Santa Chiara.&#13;
The fourth bay preserves the chapel dedicated to the Assumption of Mary with frescoes of Giovanni Corraduccio and his workshop.&#13;
The fifth bay Chapel, dedicated to St Anthony Abbot, has frescoes attributed to Giovanni di Corraduccio and his workshop and a wooden panel painted by Tiberio d’Assisi depicting The Madonna of the Succour (1510).&#13;
From the sixth bay, through a wooden door realized in 1610, it is possible to enter into the Chapel of the Annunciation, which has frescoes of Giovanni di Corraduccio and his workshop.&#13;
The apse on the right preserves the frescoes of the Master of the Apse of Montefalco; the central polygonal apse frescoed, with Scenes of the Life of St Francis by Benozzo Gozzoli, in 1452. &#13;
In the intrados, there is St Francis and The Twelve Apostles painted inside the so-called tondi—a round frame; on the vault The Glory of St Francis and SS Anthony of Padua, Clare, Bernardino from Siena, Elisabeth of Alexandria and Louis of Toulouse. On the walls, The Scenes of Life of St Francis is told from the lowest row to the left.&#13;
It is worth noting the niche in the counter façade, to the right of the main portal, where The Nativity surmounted by The Annunciation and a Blessing Christ, were frescoed by Perugino in 1503."

&#13;
The Chiesa di San Bevignate, at the gates of the town of Perugia, is in Via Enrico dal Pozzo, right in front of the Monumental Cemetery.&#13;
A series of complex factors contributed to its construction, in mid 13th century, approx. Firstly the “flagellanti”, a movement led by Raniero Fasani that starting from Perugia, in 1260, sprang up all over Italy. The emerging social class, having risen to power, felt the necessity to legitimize its authority with its own temple and saint, and chose the mysterious Bevignate, who was never canonized and of whom there is no certain documentation. Finally there were the numerous experiences of the life of the hermits in the area and the presence of the Templars, who after having settled in the territory needed a new church to substitute that of San Giustino d’Arna. The Templars succeeded in obtaining the patronage of the edifice from the Pope.&#13;
After the suppression of the Templar Order, in 1312, the church at first passed under the Knights of St John of Jerusalem, then under the nuns, the Sisters of St John, and later passed under the patronage of several confraternities, up to 1860, when it became property of the State and was entrusted to the Municipality of Perugia.&#13;
Externally the church has an unadorned façade, following the model of the edifices of the Templar Order in Palestine. The inner part of the church has a unique-nave with two spans covered by ribbed vaults and an elevated squared apse introduced by a triumphal arch. It preserves 13th-14th century frescoes of great importance, as the Procession of the Flagellant, the Battle Between the Templars and Muslims and the Legend of St Bevignate, whose mantle bears the signs of some graffiti, left between the end of the 15th and the 16th century by the pilgrims, the faithful and the Templar Knights.&#13;
After a long and complex work of restoration and consolidation to render the construction safe, on 20 April 2009, the former Templar church was officially “returned” to the town.&#13;
In the San Bevignate Church there is also organized a new exhibition space destined to host a Documentation Center on the History of the Templar Order."

Although founded in the 11th and 12th centuries, the Church of Santa Maria Maggiore shows a façade—realized on the occasion of the enlargement of the edifice—that dates back to 1644. It is worth noting the entrance doorjambs with their acanthus vine frieze, the work of stonemasons active in the 12th and 13th centuries between Foligno and Bevagna and, in part, attributed to some masters from Spoleto. The church floor plan has the shape of a Latin cross and has a cross-vaulted nave. In the second half of the 17th century, seven altars and a rich plaster—stucco—decoration were added. On the altars, there are many works ascribable to the 17th century. At the entrance, on the right, the Roman funerary marble of Caius Titienus Flaccus is re-used as a water stoup; it has been there since the 15th century. Next to it there is a baptismal font in the shape of a pix, a work of Gasparino Val di Lugano (1509-1511).&#13;
Along the left wall, after the second altar to the left, there is the Baglioni Chapel, commissioned in 1500 by Troilo Baglioni to the artist Bernardino di Betto, better known as Pinturicchio (Perugia, 1452 approx. – Siena, 11 December 1513). Its floor is richly decorated with 1566 majolica tiles from Deruta. The chapel is entirely fresco decorated by Pinturicchio, starting from the vaults there is: The Enthroned Sibyls, Tiburtine, Erithraean, European, and Samian; on the wall to the left The Annunciation with the artist’s Self-portrait and signature; on the back wall The Adoration of the Shepherds and the Arrival of the Magi; and on the wall to the right The Dispute Among Doctors at the Temple.&#13;
Along the left wall, it is also worth pointing out the sandstone Renaissance Pulpit of the artist Simone da Campione (1545). The Main Altar is covered by a Ciborium—a covered tribune supported by columns—sculpted in caciolfa limestone by Rocco di Tommaso da Vicenza (1515). In the Tondi—rounded frames—there are eight terracotta busts, the Prophets (1562), by the artist Giandomenico di Carrara. Close to the pilasters on the sides of the apse there are two works of Perugino, on the left Pieta, SS John the Evangelist and Mary Magdalene, removed from an unknown location and dated 1521, and to the right The Madonna with Child, SS Catherine of Alexandria and Biagio, removed from an unknown location, also dated 1521."

The Church of Sant’Eufemia is one of the most interesting Romanesque edifices in Umbria. It stands within the enclosure of the Archbishop Palace, in Via Saffi, one of the central roads of Spoleto.&#13;
The earliest news about this edifice remounts to the 10th century, when a Benedictine nunnery was annexed to it. In 980, Gunderada, the founding sister of the monastery, translated there the body of the Bishop John from Spoleto, who was martyrized under the Goths.&#13;
The Church was rebuilt in the first half of the 12th century, as per the Romanesque style typical of Spoleto, reminiscent of the architectonical experience of the Longobard period. During the 17th century, deleterious adaptations spoiled the original appearance of the edifice that was divided into two floors: the lower part destined for the cult; the upper part incorporated into the Bishop Palace. This situation lasted until 1907, when the complete restoration of the complex—concluded in 1954—was decided.&#13;
The sober façade, with a higher central body, is decorated by a Portal crowned with three embedded arches and surmounted by an elegant bifora—a double lancet window—and some monofore—lancet windows. The rare tripartite internal structure—a central main nave and two lateral ones divided by pilasters and columns of spolia—with three apses and matroneums, recalls that of the Church of San Lorenzo in Verona, documented in 1110.&#13;
Inside, the narthex occupies the space of the first bay and makes communication possible between the two matroneums. The presence of the matroneum is explained, according to tradition, by the presence of a pre-existing chapel—pertaining to Palazzo Ducale and built on the model of the Palatine Chapel of Aachen—here. The Main Altar comes from the Cathedral and is decorated by a beautiful 13th century antependium sculpted in low relief—with the Lamb of God and the Symbols of the Evangelists—and cosmatesque patterns. The fresco decoration of the apse is mostly lost; it preserves only God the Father and Cherubs—16th century—in the semi-dome."

The palace overlooks the square situated at the end of the road that starts from the Cathedral. The façade is divided in two parts, which mark the partition of the building in two phases. The main front, in Istrian stone, is divided by rectangular framed windows. Approximately the brick parts of the façade, like the portal, and the bell-tower can be dated back to the adjustments carried out in 1707, due to the damages cause by the Austrians. The portal opens on to a square yard surrounded by wide ogival arcades supported by pillars. Inside there is a well, oddly placed on a corner. In the interior of the church, which has obviously been modified in the course of the centuries, there are paintings by the Neapolitan artist Farelli and by Simone Salario from Atri."

The architectural structure of the building - a Mannerist masterpiece - is laid out around two large courtyards. The rooms on the ground floor, where the apartments of Federico Gonzaga and his guests were formerly located, still have the sumptuous fresco and stucco decorations executed by Giulio Romano and his assistants. The Chamber of Amor and Psyche and the Chamber of the Giants are two veritable gems of Mannerist art.
In the rooms on the upper floor various civic collections are on public display: the Gonzaga collection of cones, coins, seals, medals, weights and measures; the Mondadori donation featuring paintings by Federico Zandomeneghi and Armando Spadini, and two valuable archaeological groups: the ""Giuseppe Acerbi"" Egyptian collection and the ""Ugo Sissa"" Mesapotamian collection.

The apartments are all frescoed and containing pieces of furniture household furnishings and paintings stemming from various ages, in the library there are 5000 books. At ground floor 4 rooms decorated during the XVIII Century with stucco-work. The garden was established by Ascanio Mozzoni, a man of great culture who brought back from his travels cues for the arrangement of his garden over seven levels.
The most pleasant characteristic of the Villa is its merging with the garden. One can admire the two-flight stairway with a brook running in-between which leads directly to the halls of the Villa and also enjoy from above the sight of the beautiful panorama. The walled-in garden is a typical example of formal Italian garden with box hedges, water basins, fountains and a grotto with remarkable waterworks. Climbing towards the belvedere a more naturalistic romantic park follows.

5700,108214,traduzioni_descrizione,en,"The Fondazione Palazzo Strozzi is not only an experiment in governance – it is an experiment in sustainable innovation. Since its founding in July 2006, the key challenge of the Fondazione Palazzo Strozzi has been to bring an international approach to making culture in Florence, to provide a platform for experimentation, to provide a place for debate and discussion, to create new synergies with other cultural players, to be a catalyst for cultural change – in short, to ‘think global, act local’. In the past year the Fondazione has found several other ways to express this double mission of bringing international level cultural events to Florence, and giving the Palazzo Strozzi back to the city. One slogan, stressing the importance of seeing the Palazzo Strozzi as a single cultural destination, is'‘not just exhibitions’. This has seen the Fondazione expand its activities to include opening the Centre for Contemporary Culture Strozzina, with a wide range of exhibitions and collateral activities, as well as bringing the courtyard to life with a café, seating and wireless internet. Other slogans focus on the Palazzo Strozzi’s unique approach to creating cultural events – ‘visible listening’ and ‘eyes wide open’. <br>A key goal at the Palazzo Strozzi is to make exhibitions that are a pleasure, not a duty to visit. The Palazzo Strozzi is visitor-centred, and one of the things that makes our exhibitions special is the visitor-friendliness of all the Palazzo Strozzi’s activities – from the special labelling for families and children, labelling for the visually impaired, to the video information screens in the courtyard. The goal of all these innovations is to awaken the visitor’s curiosity, to whet their appetite for culture. Despite the difficult economic situation in 2008, which saw substantially fewer tourists in Florence, first due to the weak dollar, then due to the deepening global economic crisis, the Palazzo Strozzi hosted a strong programme of cultural events, including major exhibitions, installations of contemporary art, conferences, concerts and fashion shows."

5734,110777,traduzioni_descrizione,en,"<b>The Scuderie Reali garden</b><br>The complex of the Fabbric of the Royal Stables (Scuderie Reali) was built when Florence was a capital city, between 1866 and 1869, because of the Court’s need for larger stables, which could host horses and the quarters of the staff.<br>It includes the wide green area surrounded by the Boboli Garden, della Pace and del Mascherino streets, Machiavelli avenue and Porta Romana, where the Scuderie buildings, at the moment site of the Art Institute, and the Pagliere, used as Museum of the Figurative Arts of the 20th century, are located. There are also the smaller buildings of the former horse hospital and the “Mascalcia”, at the moment used as a residential area for administrative staff. The original structure of the Scuderie was very similar to the present one, with a rotary at the entrance of the riding track, the covered riding school, constituted by two symmetrical wings organized around the two courtyards, as well as the caretaker quarters, the cabinets for the weekly stable masters and the stable guard, and His Majest’s cabinet. The area in front of the Scuderie, the so-called Cavallerizza, was close to the building, an integral part of the surrounding garden System. We can still see the original link between the Cavallerizza and the upper floor of the Pagliere, along the embankment, through a route which was probably used for the trucks employed in the transport of hay. Complesso delle Scuderie Reali, Firenze, ripresa dall'alto This is still showed by the presence of the side gate, on the right of the street entrance to the building. Once the Court moved to Rome, the horse stables lost their original function and were not used for a long lime. In 1919 the main body, constituted by the former riding school, was assigned to the Royal Institute of Art (Regio Istituto d‘Arte), which moved its impressive collection of plaster casts of ancient models to the hall which used to be the King’s riding track.<br>The area has been subject to protective restrictions since the Ministerial Decree of November 5th, 1952: “Declaration of high public interest in the territory of the hills located in the south of the city of Florence, and in the east of the Senese Street, located with in the municipality of Florence”. The document states ""...we acknowledge that the above mentioned area constitutes, on the whole, a fundamental and characteristic element of the local scenery"".<br><b><br>The Pagliere</b><br>The Pagliere building is a complex of great architectural importance, of a unique type in the Florence building landscape. It is constituted by a long central body organized on two levels, with two lateral wings which qualify as foreparts, articulated on three levels. The prospect is characterized by an arcade on Machiavelli avenue and another one on the Porta Romana garden, with wide windows with baked clay grids.<br>The ground floor, now divided by partitions, was originally one large hall which hosted horses, marked by pillars and covered by cross vaults. The upper floor, introduced by the loggia, was used as a warehouse for hay. It received air through the arch openings, with the characteristic architectural pattern of the baked clay grids.<br>The floor shows the original function, being the path where the cattle trucks would drive in stone rather than in baked clay. The two lateral bodies hosted the staff and are still partially inhabited by the personnel of the Soprintendenza who take care of the building. The building of the Pagliere was left unused for a long time, until the beginning of the 30s when it became the location of the scenography workshops of the City Theatre. The new destination was chosen because of the spaciousness of the room, where the scenography sets were created, and due to the strict link between the Theatre and the scenography workshop of the School, at that lime famous in Italy for the quality of the teachers, above all in painting and decorative sculpture. From 1932 to 1959 the monumental backcloths were painted at the Pagliere, where artists such as Giorgio de Chirico, Felice Casorati, Cipriano Efisio Oppo, Gino Severini, Toti Scialoja and Mario Sironi used to come to check the execution of their projects. The building was then used as a warehouse by the some Theatre, from 1950 to 1987.<br>The original function of the building is well recognizable from the large windows in brick grids, as well as from the direction of the factory bodies, which allowed a perfect air circulation, necessary to preserve the&nbsp; hay (paglia). The south facades, better exposed to the Sun, are protected by the arcade, whereas the north facades have larger size to allow the highest light and air penetration, in a transversai direction. <br>"

Though the presence of a fortress is documented as from the Angevin age, the building of the present structure started only when the dynasty of Aragon ascended the power, that is in the mid fifteenth century or a short time later. As a consequence of the landing of Venetian plunderers and the subsequent sack in 1447, it was decided to build a new fortress.

The fortress of Calascio, fortified and enlarged in the XV century by order of the family Piccolomini, is one of the highest bastions in Italy. From its height it overlooks the plain of Navelli and the Tirino Valley. It consists of a square plan with four corner-towers. The entrance door lies five meters above the ground, which made suppose that a wood ladder was used to enter the building and then withdrawn. Near the ruins there is the little church of Santa Maria della Pietà, situated over a former votive chapel. The present building, dating back to the XVI century, has an octagonal plan surmounted by a cupola made up of eight sections; the sacristy is built against one of the external facades of the church."

The town-walls were probably enlarged by Alfonse of Aragon at the end of the fifteenth century and at the beginning of the sixteenth Bernardo Buontalenti, in order to adapt the fortress to the changed defensive needs, added to its structure five circular ramparts and a pentagonal one. The real fortress on the top of the mountain extends for more than five hundred meters on the rocky ridge and covers a surface of 25,000 square meters. The present structure, restored in the Seventies of the last century, was built by order of the king of Spain Philip II of Habsburg in the second half of the sixteenth century and replaced the previous fort. The nineteenth-century tactical adjustments made the fortress strong enough to be the last bulwark against the Piedmontese siege in 1860-61. In 1988 the Museum of the Fortress was founded and situated in a few rooms of the building, which had previously functioned as an artillery depot. It exhibits a collections of arms and cannons dating from the Renaissance to the two big battles of the nineteenth century, in 1806 and 1860.</div>"

From the important original collections, a first part was given in 1865 to the City of Milan to form the primitive core of the ""Civic Art Collections of the Castello Sforzesco"". In 1933, with the establishment of the Foundation Morando Bolognini, furniture and furnishings in the Castle would become the ""Museum Morando Bolognini"" in Sant'Angelo Lodi. Then, in 1945, the remainder of the collection of art, together with the Morando Bolognini palace in Via Sant'Andrea in Milan, was donated to the City of Milan, where it is currently exhibited as a ""Museum of Milan"".
Among the 24 rooms lavishly furnished in the style of ""House-Museum, are of particular interest the Library, which houses about 2000 volumes e weapons room, consisting of around 500 pieces of various ages and proveniences. Worthy of note are the Throne Room, the Hall of Ancestors, a Chapel, a Hall of Mirrors and the Dining rooms.

It was built in 1580-1590, perhaps to fortify a pre-existing structure dating back to&nbsp; the 14th century. It is part of a coastal defence system wanted by Philip II of Spain against Barbaresque raids. Garrisoned in 1590-91, it had an important role until 1847. Originally the fortress had a triangular shape. In 1790 it became quadrangular and small ramparts were added on the four corners, giving the fortress its characteristic star shape."

<p class=""MsoBodyText""><span lang=""EN-GB"">Also called Castle of Burgos, the Castle
of Goceano was named after a region in mid- north Sardinia. It rises on a
granite hill dominating the town of Burgos, 647m above sea level. In the
fourteenth century it was considered one of the best defended Sardinian
castles. Built in 1334 by Gonario I, judge of Torres, it was under the rule of
Genova, then the Doria family and finally, in the mid- fourteenth century,
under the judges of Arborea. Adelasia, last judge of Torres, was locked up and
died inside this castle. The fortified structure, irregular in plan, is
articulated in a wall circuit built of stones and bricks with several loop-
holes, a room dug into the rock and the main tower. The lower part of the wall
was made higher during the 15th century under the rule of the Aragonese. The
square main tower consists of two levels built of rough calcareous blocks,
supported by red vulcanite blocks. Several rooms faced an inner courtyard, where
is the entrance to an underground room, perhaps a tank. North of the main
tower, other rooms were maybe destined to troops and the servants of the
castle. </span></p>

Classified as a demographic, ethnological and anthropological museum, it is managed by the Associazione Museo del Lino and has over 9,000 items illustrating rural life on the plain before the advent of agricultural mechanization. 
The ground floor presents equipment used in the linen production cycle, from the sowing of flax to weaving, and some beautifully embroidered wedding-chest items.
The rooms on the upper floor house a section on the breeding of silkworms, with two of the very few throwing machines now known to exist, and sections on the preservation of food and lighting as well as working tools and objects of everyday life. The museum also has a rich collection of artefacts mostly dating from the 19th century.

          Ponte Nossa is a small village located at the Orobie Pre-Alps, at around thirty km from Bergamo, Italy. Its name could be translated as ""Bridge on the Nossa river "", though this is just one of many hypotheseson the name's origins. The Nossa is e very short (half a kilometer) river nevertheless endowed with a high, constant flow. Its springs currently feed the water supply system of the chief town Bergamo and around thirty villages in the same province.
In the XVth century these springs provided the necessary water for the functioning of four huge hydraulic hammers (magli) for iron working and, later, also for some fulling mills. Iron was brought to the hammers from mines in the nearby mountains. I was smelled and forget to make nails, spades, hoes or other objects used by local farmers.
The cultural association Associazione Magli Nossa, supported by the Municipality of Ponte Nossa, was re-founded with the aim of restoring the area where these preindustrial structures were built bringing back to life its ancient traditions.
What else to see in Ponte Nossa: the parish church an sanctuary which contains a sacred image of Our Lady who cried blood on 2 June 1511, the small church of San Bernardino, on the river Serio, and the former cotton mill De Angeli Frua, now an excellent example of industrial archaeological site.

The bridge collapsed after an earthquake in 1088 and was re-built in the thirteenth century in a medieval typology; a chapel consecrated to the Virgin was erected upon it and then restored and enlarged in the following centuries until it became the present Church of the Holy Mary of the Bridge. The church occupied the ground of the bridge and thus became a hallway for merchants who travelled towards the plain of fairs. Finally, in 1520 a vaulted passageway was built under the church and a walkway on its left side. The underground rooms of the churches of the Holy Mary of the Bridge and of Saint Francis contain an exhibition about the building phases of the bridge of Diocletian, the remains of the earliest church of the Eucharistic Miracle and to other local archaeological finds.</div>"

It was built as from 1158, after that the old church of Santa Maria Aprutiensis had been destroyed in 1155 by the army of Robert, Count of Loretello. In the Thirties of the twentieth century the church was detached from the surrounding buildings but the renovation did not affect the original façade, encircled at the top with merlots, and the Romanic portal, dated 1332 and carved by Diodato Romano, with fifteenth-century ornaments, like the group representing the Annunciation by Nicola da Guardiagrele. In 1493 Antonio from Lodi added to the twelfth-century belfry a high octagonal spire with polychrome ceramic insets, which will be reproduced in other near-by towns, such as Atri, Penne, Città Sant'Angelo and Loreto Aprutino. The restoration of 1932-35 deeply altered the interior of the cathedral, removing the ornamental and architectural structures added in 1739 by Lazzaro Giosaffatti from Ascoli. Nowadays the inside, in bare stone, as maybe it used to be in the twelfth century, consists of a nave and two aisles with a cupola in the middle. The ending part of the choir, in fourteenth-fifteenth-century style, with large ogival arches on high pillars, was carried out on the initiative of the bishop Niccolò degli Arcioni as an extension of the church. A magnificent silver frontal representing scenes from the Gospel and saints, embosomed by Nicola da Guardiagrele between 1433 and 1448, hangs over the central altar. Inside the Baroque chapel of Saint Berardo an excellent frontal overhangs: attributed to Jacobello del Fiore, it portrays the Virgin's coronation and the town of Teramo as it appeared in the fifteenth century; it was moved to the Cathedral from its primary location in the church of Saint Agustin.</div>"

century along the Romea Road, between Venice and Ravenna. During the 
eleventh century, it reached its peak in economic, cultural and 
spiritual expansion, to which both the atrium of the church, 
characterized by the simple architecture decorated with strips of 
terracotta and cornices around, and the bell tower (1063) belonged. The 
Abbey experienced an inexorable decline, which culminated in the 
abandonment by the monks in the seventeenth century, but the fourteenth 
century shows evidence of great quality: the frescoes of the Church, 
started in 1351 by Vitale da Bologna, the Chapter House (dell'Aula 
Capitolare) (by 1310), the works in the Refectory attributed to Pietro 
da Rimini (1320 ca.). The story is summarized in the Abbey Museum, which
 holds an interesting collection of artifacts and art works from the 
sixth to the nineteenth century.</div><div align=""justify""><br></div>"

<p class=""MsoNormal""></p><div align=""justify"">Torrechiara Castle is one of the most famous amongst the fortresses that
 were part of the feud of the estate of Pier Maria Rossi, Count of San 
Secondo and a great leader, who made renovations in the fifteenth 
century. At the end of his military activities, he retired here with 
Bianca Pellegrini of Como, who for his sake, had left her husband, 
Melchior d'Arluno. Pier Maria Rossi wanted to show testimony of the love
 in their relationship and in 1452 it seems he probably asked the 
painter Benedetto Bembo to decorate the fresco of the 'Gold Room', a tale of courtly love and chivalry, recounting the story of Pier Maria 
Rossi's passion for Bianca Pellegrini. The two lovers are represented as
 being struck by the arrows of a Blindfolded Cupid, while in the 
painting Bianca appears dressed in white as a pilgrim and following a 
path which touches all the castles of Pier Maria. Torrechiara, 
rectangular shaped, with three surrounding walls and corner towers, 
machicolations, and a large courtyard, was subject to various extensions
 and restorations in the seventeenth century, and the wide panoramic 
balconies opened to the side of the valley. The room on the second floor
 of the North-East side of the building is decorated with grotesques 
by Cesare Baglione.</div><p></p>

6005,20725,traduzioni_descrizione,en,"<div align=""justify"">The first account of the existence of a pharmacy in
 the Abbey of San Giovanni Evangelista in Parma dates back to 1201, but 
its foundation could be even earlier, since the monastery was founded in
 980 AD. It is likely, that at first it was only used as a Pharmacy 
Service to the Benedictines and that only later became a public pharmacy
 service. The current interior dates from the late sixteenth century and
 the beginning of the next century, whilst the layout of the premises 
underwent radical changes in 1766 when the Benedictines had to 
secularize the pharmacy to avoid its permanent closure, which was 
imposed by the Bourbon Minister Guglielmo Du Tillot. In 1896 the State 
acquired the premises, which it then reopened to the public in 1951, 
displaying a collection of mortars, earthenware jars, pots, stills and 
other objects obtained from governmental and private donations. Of the 
eight original areas of the Pharmacy, four still remain today, namely 
the “la Sala del Fuoco”, “la Sala dei Mortai”, “la Sala delle Sirene” 
and finally “la Sala del Pozzo”. (Hall of Fire, the Hall of Mortars, the
 Hall of the Sirens and finally the Hall of the Well). All the rooms are
 named after their specific contents or decorative elements that 
characterize them.<br></div>"

across the private apartment of the Abbess, Giovanna da Piacenza, 
located in the ancient Benedictine monastery of St. Paul, which at the 
beginning of the sixteenth century was one of the most important 
cultural centers of the city. After passing through a few areas, one 
arrives at the almost perfect symmetrical room whose ceiling was painted
 in 1514 by Alessandro Parma using rich ornamentation and grotesque 
painted candelabras, in which are included both sacred scenes and 
profane images. The room which was painted by Antonio Allegri Correggio 
in 1519, was done in the Renaissance style. It was painted using 
illusionistic decorations and young vine shoots which open onto fake 
ovals with cherubs, whilst the lower part of the room is completed with 
fake niches in monochrome containing mythological figures. The fireplace
 holds a representation of Diana, an obvious reference to the abbess 
Giovanna da Piacenza, who commissioned the work, and whose heraldic 
emblem is at the center of the ceiling.</div>"

 the turn of the fifteenth and sixteenth century, before Correggio 
became famous, and representing two scenes from the Life of Saint 
Catherine of Alexandria, namely, the ""dispute of Catherine before the 
Emperor Massimino"" and ""St. Catherine and St. Jerome."" in 1514. The 
style of Araldi seems to be in contrast with the particular awareness

outside, and circular one inside with diaconicon sides and prosthesis, 
as well as early medieval crypts. The interior is divided into three 
aisles, by twenty-four Greek marble columns.  The carved capitals of the
 columns depict ""acanthus leaves blowing in the wind"", but unlike most 
such carvings, the leaves appear twisted as if being buffeted by the 
wind. The rich mosaic decoration includes the representation of St. 
Apollinare in the background of a green landscape in the apse, and the 
sanctuary depicts the sacrifices of the Old Testament and the delivery 
of the privileges of the church of Ravenna (VII century).<br><br>The Basilica of St. Apollinare in Classe is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.<br></div><!--EndFragment-->"

cliff of white sandstone, now reduced to a limited portion of the 
originally fortified area, due to the phenomenon of erosion of the soil.
 The characteristics of the surrounding landscapes and historical 
heritage make it a place of extraordinary interest. It was built around 
940 by Adalberto Azzo, from Lombard, and became the center of a complex 
defensive system used to control the mountain valleys and plains. In 950
 Adelaide, widow of Lothair I, king of Italy, found refuge in this 
castle. The fame of Canossa is linked to the historic meeting on 27 
January 1077, between the owners Countess Matilda and the Abbot, Hugh of
 Cluny, and Pope Gregory VII who excommunicated Emperor Henry IV and 
forced him to grant him absolution. Over the centuries the castle was 
destroyed and rebuilt several times, but the archaeological 
investigations have brought to light many elements. In 1878, after it 
was purchased by the Italian government, it was declared a National 
Monument. The site is also set up as a small museum ""Naborre Campanini"",
 which houses artifacts from the excavations of the castle, during the 
years 1877 and 1893. The contents of the museum relate to many themes, 
from the time of Countess Matilda to the history of the excavation and 
the history of the Castle to the surrounding area. &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></div>"

In fact,&nbsp; it is the largest amphitheatre not only in the city of Rome but in the world, able to offer stunning sceneries as well as services for spectators. Symbol of the pageantry of the Empire, over the centuries the Amphitheatre has changed its face and its function, offering itself as a structured space also open to the Roman community. Today, the Colosseum is a monument unto itself and unto the works of human genius, which survive time; yet it is still comfortable and dynamic, accessible on two levels offering a wide overview onto its interiors, but also short and evocative brief glimpses of the city from its outer arches.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It also hosts temporary exhibitions related to the timeless theme of the ""Ancient"" and its relationship with the “Contemporary”, as well as modern performances. This outcome&nbsp; of events and experiences makes the amphitheatre a new place every day, significant for all and able to tell everybody a story."

Le prince Emanuele Filiberto en confia les travaux d'agrandissement et de transformation en villa cossue à Guarino Guarini en 1676. Du projet de Guarini on réalisa la façade vers le parc et le pavillon central qui ferme la cour intérieure.
Les travaux interrompus furent repris en 1755 et confiés à Giovanni Battista Borra qui réalisa la façade néoclassique principale. Les transformations internes furent réalisées par Guarino Guarini au Dix-septième, par Gian Battista Borra au Dix-huitième et au Dix-neuvième par Pelagio Palagi.
A l'intérieur se trouvent de nombreuses salles décorées et meublées avec des meubles et des oeuvres d¿art du Dix-septième au Vingtième. Certaines des salles les plus fastueuses du château sont: le Salon de Diana avec des bas-reliefs de stuc du Dix-huitième et la Salle de lecture.
Au dos du château se trouve le vaste et très beau parc dans lequel se trouvent les serres et les ""Margherie"" ensemble formé de différentes pièces, concernant la chasse; édifié sur projet de Pelagio Palagi en 1834."
6131,20505,traduzioni_descrizione,en,"Old stronghold transformed into a castle by the Marquises of Saluzzo and acquired by the Savoy Dynasty in 1605. The Prince Emanuele Filiberto entrusted the enlargement and transformation into an aristocratic villa to Guarino Guarini in 1676. The façade facing the park and the central pavilion closing the internal courtyard were part of the Guarini project.
The works were interrupted and resumed in 1755, entrusted to Giovanni Battista Borra who made the neoclassical main façade. Guarino Guarini in the 17th century and Pelagio Palagi in the 19th made the internal transformations.
Inside there are many halls decorated and furnished with works of art and furniture from the 17th to the 20th century. Some of the most magnificent halls of the castle are: the Diana hall, with stucco bas-reliefs from the 18th century, and the reading room. Behind the castle there is a large, magnificent park, in which the greenhouses and the ""Margherie"" complex are found, made of various rooms related to hunting.

Von dem Guarino-Entwurf wurde nur die Fassade, die auf die Parkanlage geht, und der zentral Pavillon, der den Hinterhof abschließt, realisiert.
Die unterbrochenen Arbeiten wurden 1755 wieder aufgenommen und Giovanni Battista Borra anvertraut, der die die klassizistischea Hauptfassade realisiert. Die Veränderungen innen erfolgten im 17. Jahrhundert durch Guarino Guarini und im 18. Jh. durch Gian Battista Borra und schließlich im 19. Jh durch Pelagio Palagi.

&#13;
Standing on the highest hillside of the town, the Rocca Maggiore fortress of Assisi is reachable by going up Via Porta Perlici, near the Cattedrale of San Rufino, or by taking the exterior beltway that arrives right at the top of the Asio Hill.&#13;
The first historical records of this fortified structure date back to 1173-1174, when Christian, Archbishop of Mainz, sacked Assisi on behalf of Emperor Frederick Barbarossa. In 1198, a popular uprising tore down the Fortress. Tradition says that on this occasion the townspeople kicked out Conrad I von Urslingen, the Duke of Spoleto, together with the little Frederick II, who at the time was only four years old. What remained of the fortress remained neglected until 1362, when Cardinal Gil Albornoz decided to rebuild it over the ancient German fortifications.&#13;
The imposing and austere Rocca Maggiore fortress overlooks the historical city center of Assisi, the Tescio River’s narrow ravine standing below and a large part of the Umbrian Valley, which extends from Perugia to Spoleto. Visiting its structure provides the opportunity to observe a significant example of still well preserved 14th century military architecture, and at the same time to enjoy one of the most suggestive panoramas of Umbria.&#13;
The itinerary of the Tour introduces the visitor inside the Albornoz style fortress—with its squared plan—that consists of a Keep and a Polygonal Tower and has been integrated during the centuries with a surrounding system of walls and towers.&#13;
At the time of the Signoria of Biordo Michelotti—ruling between 1394 and 1398—several interventions of maintenance and restoration were executed; his coat of arms is sculpted in various parts of the fortress.&#13;
In 1458, to its northwest side, a Polygonal Tower was raised under the orders of Jacopo Piccinino. The next year, Pope Pius II ordered the construction of the Corridor that connected the Rocca with the Polygonal Tower. The entrance door near the Keep was opened in 1484; three coats of arms are sculpted above it, the one at the center is that of Pope Sixtus IV. At the end of the 15th century the Rocca became the theater of vicious fights between the families of the Fiumi and the Nepis. In 1501, first Cesare Borgia and later his sister Lucrezia settled to live there.&#13;
The last important construction interventions on the Rocca fortress were executed in 1535, when Pope Paul III ordered the construction of the Circular Bastion.&#13;
After its primary defensive function, the Rocca Maggiore became a residence of the castellans, custodians charged with the security of the surrounding territory. It later became a prison and then a warehouse. Appreciated again, and enhanced by restoration work, the Rocca can be visited by tourists today. The entrance door opens near the 16th century Bastion; inside there is a Courtyard, all paved with bricks of the 14th century; on the side there is the Donjon, where the service rooms were located. The Keep was the house of the castellan; there are five rooms inside it—one above the other—that are joined together by a spiral staircase."

6501,20104,traduzioni_descrizione,en,"<div align=""justify""><div align=""justify"">The Farnese Theatre, located on the first floor of 
the Pilotta Palace, was built in the ancient Hall of Arms (Sala d'arme)
 of the court, between 1617 and 1618, by the architect Giovan Battista 
Aleotti from Ferrara, nicknamed Argenta. Built with materials which 
were frequently utilised for temporary structures in the Renaissance 
era, like wood and stucco, which was painted to simulate marble and 
precious metals. The theatre was created at the wishes of the Duke of 
Parma and Piacenza, Ranuccio I Farnese (1593-1622), who wanted to 
magnificently celebrate the stopover in Parma, of the Grand Duke of 
Tuscany, Cosimo II de 'Medici, who was traveling to Milan to conclude a 
marriage agreement between the two families. The visit of this 
distinguished guest's faded away in vain and the inauguration only 
occurred in 1628, with the wedding between Margherita de 'Medici and the
 Duke Odoardo, with the allegorical ""show"" entitled ""Mercury and Mars"" 
(text and music by Claudio Achillini and music by Claudio Monteverdi) 
culminating in spectacular ""naumachia"" (naval battle). Due to the 
complexity of the stage and its' high cost, the theater was used only on
 nine occasions, for ducal wedding or important state visits. It was 
almost completely destroyed by Allied bombing in May 1944, and the 
theatre was rebuilt from 1956 according to the original plan. Since 1986 
it has become the spectacular access to the museum's exhibition spaces. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div></div>"

HISTORIALE was born to honour all victims of all nationalities that lost their life for peace and freedom. Until 2010 the museum has been visited by 200 000 people, among students, veterans and tourists of all nationalities. The museum complex is part of a well-kept complex that offers spaces for topic exhibitions. The tour is adapted to the type of visitors; from schoolchildren to students, from individual tourists to groups. The tourists, accompanied by guides, take awareness from the outside, that they are on a symbolic territory: in fact the museum is located at the foot of the mountain where is the Benedictine abbey, cradle of European civilization, repeatedly destroyed and repeatedly build again."

          The Castello Sforzesco Extra-European Collections comprise a number of ethnographic and historical collections previously belonging to various public bodies in Milan. 
Inaugurated in 1858, the ethnographic and archaeological section of the Museo Civico di Storia Naturale received consignments of objects and items from various parts of the world on a regular basis. Together with Luigi Narducci, Antonio Raimondi was one of the first to send material from Peru. 
A donation made to the Museo Patrio di Archeologia in 1892 led to the creation of another public ethnographic collection in Milan and was followed in 1893 by the incorporation of the prehistoric and ethnographic material from the Museo di Storia Naturale.
With the creation of the Castello Sforzesco museum system, the collection of the Museo Patrio di Archeologia was transferred to the castle together with others. 
In its new location, the collection was further expanded through the transfer of more material from the Museo di Storia Naturale in 1929. 
This was followed by various donations to the now established Ethnographic Collection of Castello Sforzesco, including the important Cordani gift of Mexican items in 1931 and the Vigoni gift of African artefacts in 1935. 
Bombing in August 1943 caused the destruction of most of the ethnographic material in the castle, the American nucleus being practically the sole survivor. 
Numerous donations in the post-war period then made it possible to replenish the collection. 
With the gradual specialization of the various sections of Castello Sforzesco, the ethnographic collection was renamed the Extra-European Collection and became part of the municipal collections of applied art.
In view of the growing importance of the Extra-European Collection, only a very small part of which is currently exhibited in the Castello Sforzesco (rooms 30 and 36 in the Rocchetta Courtyard), it was decided in 2000 to created a purpose-built museum, the Centre of Cultures, which is currently under construction in the former Ansaldo industrial area near Porta Genova. Completion is scheduled for 2015.

          The University of Pavia Museo di Mineralogia developed towards the end of the 18th century out of the ""mineral kingdom"" section of the Museo di Storia Naturale founded by Lazzaro Spallanzani. Its collections have expanded constantly ever since through purchases, exchanges and donations. It is currently housed in the ample premises made available by the Department of Earth Sciences and the Environment in the Science Centre of University of Pavia.
The material is divided into various collections, the most important of which is systematic in character while others are based on regional criteria or focus at a smaller scale on particular localities of mineralogical interest. There is also an educational collection displaying the ""essential"" minerals of a small systematic collection alongside groups of minerals showing the most important types of habitus and examples of twin crystals that are particularly well formed in accordance with the most important twin laws. Jaspers and other cut gemstones purchased by the museum in the early years of the 19th century are on display in a fine historical collection.

          The University of Pavia Museo di Storia Naturale was created in 1771 by order of Maria Theresa of Austria, who appointed Lazzaro Spallanzani, holder of the chair in natural history, as its director. The collections expanded considerably under his guidance through purchases, exchanges and donations, and the museum soon became one of most famous of its kind in Europe. 
The 19th century saw a second period of splendour with further expansion of the collections, not least through the contributions of great explorers.
The museum currently houses the ancient material in different premises. The Zoology section includes thousands of stuffed birds and mammals, numerous amphibians, reptiles and fish preserved in liquid, and a very rich collection of insects. The Comparative Anatomy section includes preparations of organs and mounted skeletons, and the important Palaeontology section boasts over 30,000 specimens of fossil animals and plants.

          The Pavia garden of herbs (Orto dei Semplici), mentioned as early as 1558, was relocated between 1772 and 1774 as a botanical garden in its present grounds and premises (previously the rectory of Sant'Epifanio). Work began in 1776 on the construction of the wooden conservatories (architect G. Piermarini), which were rebuilt in masonry at the beginning of the 19th century (architect L. Canonica). These are known as the ""Scopoli conservatories"" after the physician and botanist G.A. Scopoli, who taught there from 1777 to 1788 and also planted the monumental plane tree to north of them. The new conservatories built in the 19th century included the Briosi orangery. The present layout was developed in the period 1945- 48 by R. Ciferri on the model of the grounds of 17th and 18th-century Lombard villas. R. Tomaselli had a hothouse built for tropical species in 1974. The botanical garden covers an area of two hectares and has approximately 2,000 species. There are azaleas and roses to the south, conifers to the south-east, and broad-leaf species between the building and the conservatories. The Scopoli conservatories contain succulents and cycadaceae.

&#13;
The Teatro Torti is in Piazza San Silvestri, the main square of Bevagna, and is part of—together with the Civic Museum and the Roman Thermal Baths Mosaic—the Museums City Circuit, the Circuito Museale Cittadino. &#13;
It was built in 1886, on a design of the architect Antonio Martini, inside the old Palazzo dei Consoli, which was the old municipal premises until the 1832 earthquake, and it is dedicated to the man of letters Francesco Torti. &#13;
Its construction was strongly desired by the townspeople, who reunited in a promoting committee in 1871. The inauguration was held the evening of 28 August 1886, and for the occasion Alferdo Lupi, the Impresario, set the scene for the representation of the Opera of the Ernani—of Giuseppe Verdi—together with the Educande di Sorrento.&#13;
On the ground floor, a Loggia still remains covered by three majestic Gothic arches and a smaller one, which was probably used as an entrance to a commercial space.&#13;
It is one of the smallest theaters of Umbria, there are only 251 seats, but it is finely decorated and contains interesting paintings of the 19th century.&#13;
Its floor plan is horseshoe-shaped, there are three orders of balconies—galleries—and a loggia; the parapet is made of a series of pig-iron columns.&#13;
The ceiling, frescoed by Mariano Piervittori, represents The Dancing Muses. The curtain is original and was painted by Domenico Bruchi, with Propertius Pointing to Torti His Fatherland, in 1886. During the 1994 restoration work, another curtain was painted by Luigi Frappi, a painter from Bevagna, depicting the Clitunno River with a poetical cippus and a small Temple.&#13;
On the coat of arms above the curtain dating from 1380, donated by Pope Innocent IV, one can read the letters ”OsF” that stands for the Latin motto “Ob servatam Fidem” [For Having Preserved and Followed Faith in the Church].&#13;
After the work of restoration the theater has been constantly active."

It saw the light as a small private theater at the beginning of the 18th century, as an annex to the countryside home of the noble family of the Vitelli, with which it is connected by a bridge-like terrace above the main road. After a period of abandonment, at the beginning of the 1800s the property shifted to the Municipality, which rebuilt a rather simple theater audience hall, with a wooden stage, some mobile scenes, some benches and eight brick columns to support the gallery.&#13;
The rather serious damage procured by the 1917 earthquake required some restoration work. At this point the room acquired a new Art Nouveau light gallery with a curved plan, supported by six pig-iron fluted columns with acanthus capitals. The metal baluster displays a honeycomb pattern with a central motif depicting a Lyre.&#13;
A flight of wooden steps leads up to this sort of tribune of honor facing the stage, which can host a few spectators.&#13;
Restored once more during the 20th century, it was reopened and brought back to full activity in 1991. Its full capacity is 99 spectators."
6949,108126,traduzioni_descrizione,en,"“Degli Illuminati” Theater&#13;
&#13;
The Accademia Letteraria degli Illuminati of Città di Castello, devoted to St Illuminato, built its first theater—all in wood—in 1666, which was torn-down after a hundred years of activity. In 1783, following a memorial presented by the townspeople to the Sacra Consulta of Rome—a Papal State governmental body—the Academics decided to rebuild it in brickwork.&#13;
Once the work was executed—whose cost was 885 Italian scudi—the new theater, the Teatro degli Illuminati, was reopened to the public in 1796 with a prose play and balls as intermezzos. In 1861, the theater was restored and embellished with stuccowork and gildings by the painter Giuseppe Bianchi, from Florence, who was also the author of the stage curtain. The Perugian Vincenzo Baldini painted the sceneries, and the theater reopened to the public in 1862 with the Opera Lucrezia Borgia of Donizzetti and the Traviata of Verdi. Having been restored several times, today the Teatro degli Illuminati is an elegant and resounding theater, with its four orders of boxes –17 for each tier—and a loggia created in 1887 together with the audience hall ceiling painting, the work of the Perugian Ulisse Ribustini."

Once an aristocratic Summer Residence built by the Barons Leopoldo and Giulio Franchetti, in the second half of the 19th century, La Montesca stands on the slope of Mount Arnato. It was built on a design of the Florentine architect Giuseppe Bocccini. The Villa dominates, from its panoramic position, the upper course of the Tiber River and the town of Città di Castello. The typical landscape of the “Valtiberina”, with its sweet hills, cultivated flat and woods frame this example of a 19th century Residence, inspired by the Renaissance and Mannerism.&#13;
The Villa is divided into three bodies—the central one has three floors sided by two higher lateral tower-like wings—due to the insertion of a Florentine style covered Loggia on the roof. Today the design of the façade is punctuated by its arched portal entrance, the arches of the portico and the white stone rusticated-framed windows. The interior of the Villa is elegant, rich with sumptuous halls, paintings and sculptures of Clemente Marini, Giovanni Panti, Ernesto Bellanti and Antonio Passaglia.&#13;
The complex also includes the Warden House, the Lemon-house, the Guest-quarters and the Montessori school. It was in Villa Montesca where, in 1901, a free elementary school for peasants’ children was founded. This is the place where this educational experience led by Maria Montessori—called by Alice Franchetti Hallgarten, the American wife of Senator Leopoldo Franchetti, a cultured woman with a philanthropic spirit—accomplished its first steps.&#13;
The wide garden with a central pool opens in front of the house. The English Garden, a true botanical garden, is rich with a large variety of plants from America. &#13;
The Villa, property of the Umbria Region, has maintained its educative function. In fact, it hosts a Center for training and research."

&#13;
The Church of San Domenico hosting the Auditorium, with the annexed Convent, is certainly one of the most significant monuments of Foligno.&#13;
Used as stables by the army in the 1870s, then as a gymnasium and finally as a deposit, the former church preserves an authentic anthology of late Gothic painting. It was only after the collapse of the ceiling in 1976 that the authorities started to operate for a real recovery of its structure, work that would be brought to an end twenty years later. Today the halls of the Auditorium are variegated and polyvalent. While its external body has remained unaltered, in the inside two flying bridges—the same height as and like modern twins of the pre-existing “matroneums”—were realized to allow the management of the theater lighting. The internal staging has been designed to allow a polyvalent use of the space. In correspondence with the transept, a steel-structured sound reflector has been foreseen. &#13;
The seats of the Auditorium parterre are partly fixed and partly mounted in retractable telescopic tribunes."

&#13;
Palazzo Trinci stands on the northern side of Piazza della Repubblica, which is the ancient Platea Magna—great arena—and the beating heart of the town of Foligno.&#13;
This is the most representative edifice of the town. It was built by the Trinci family and decorated by one of the greatest interpreters of the Italian Late Gothic, Gentile da Fabriano. &#13;
It is almost an obligation to visit its premises to admire the marvelous rooms, the chapel of the palace and the important archaeological and historic-artistic collections it has hosted since 2000. &#13;
Having already been the seat of the Signoria—lordship—of the Trinci family—who ruled the town from 1305 to 1439—this palace was built and richly decorated by restructuring a number of pre-existing medieval edifices, between the end of the 14th and the beginning of the 15th century as desired by Ugolino Trinci.&#13;
With the end of the rule of the Trinci and the annexing of Foligno to the Papal State, the palace became the See of Papal Legates, maintaining this function until the Unification of Italy, when it was designated for offices. With the loss of its original function, the palace was adapted in various ways, and also modified as a consequence of the damages it suffered after the earthquake and the Second World War bombings. The edification of the neoclassical façade dates from the 19th century. The passageway on the right, which connected the palace with the houses built above the minor nave of the cathedral, preserves a masonry facing and a mullion window that dates from the beginning of the 15th century. Other architectural bodies from the same period are visible in the court, which has a brickwork porch with cross vaults. The staircase on the right leads into the palace, now seat of the Museum of the town.&#13;
On the first floor there is the Gothic Staircase that once was uncovered, in the open air, which is all decorated with geometrical designs. On the second floor there is the Sixtus IV Hall, a vast hallway decorated with frescoes and ornamental motifs, with a wooden ceiling with the Coat of Arms of the Pope inlayed at its center. At the end of the room there is the chapel frescoed by Ottaviano Nelli, with the Scenes from the life of the Virgin, which can be dated from 1424.  In the nearby Loggia there are frescoes with the Scenes from the foundation of Rome—these are not all complete, in fact, in some areas they remain partially designed as a Sinopia—allusively comparing Roman power with that of Foligno. From the Loggia there is access to the Liberal Arts and the Planets Room, where the Trivium and Quadrivium Arts, Philosophy and The Seven Planets, to which The Ages of Man and The Hours of the Day, are connected. These personifications illustrate the elaborated allegorical concept in which life is divided into seven stages, each one influenced by a planet; and a learning discipline corresponds to every age. Furthermore, the frescoes in the passageway, connecting the palace with the Duomo, return to the theme of The Ages of Man. On the front wall The Heroes of Antiquity and The Brave Men of the Medieval Tradition are depicted. The Room of the Giants, to which access is secured through the room behind the Liberal Arts and the Planets Room, is instead frescoed with the colossal figures of The Heroes from the History of Rome, from Romulus to Trajan, all dressed—as per Renaissance customs—in medieval clothes. Their names are written, together with poems by Francesco da Fiano in Latin, below the figures.&#13;
From a recent discovery of an 18th century pocketbook, a transcription of an ancient document of 1411, it clearly shows that the frescoes of the Loggia, the Room of the Liberal Arts and the Planets and the Room of the Giants were commissioned to Gentile da Fabriano, who executed them with the cooperation of some of his pupils."

&#13;
The Palazzo dei Consoli is clearly visible from a long distance and stands in the historical city center of Gubbio.&#13;
Its façade overlooks Piazza Grande, a highly elevated terrace, and political fulcrum of the 14th century town.&#13;
Today, this building is the seat of the Civic Museum, where it is possible to admire the Egubine Tablets, a precious bronze evidence of the Umbrian language.&#13;
The palace was built, between 1332 and 1349, based on a design of Angelo da Orvieto—remembered with an inscription above the entrance door—with the contribution of Matteo di Giovannello, known as the Gattapone. &#13;
Its Floor Plan is rectangular, and its facade possesses a great Gothic verticality accentuated by lesenes—which are low-relief pillars resembling pilasters—dividing its front into three separate parts. &#13;
The first order is dominated by the portal, to which access is gained through a fan shaped staircase; in the lunette above the door there is the 1495 fresco of Bernardino di Nanni dell’Eugenia, depicting the Madonna with Child between SS Johan the Baptist and Ubaldus. The painting was heavily modified in the 16th century by Benedetto Nucci. Two mullion windows—each surmounted by a round arch—open on both sides of the portal.&#13;
The second order is decorated with six round arch windows with an indented frame—corbelled table—frieze connecting the arches.&#13;
A crenellated parapet supported by a corbel table made of ogival arches crowns the palace, while a Bell Tower rises on its left side. &#13;
The façades on the right and the backsides of the palace, both visible from Via dei Consoli, maintain features similar to the main one. On the left side, another edifice-body, with a portico descending into Via Baldassini, was built against the main-body of the palace.&#13;
The Arengo Hall, in which part of the Civic Museum’s stone collection is held, is covered by majestic barrel vaults and occupies the entire first floor.&#13;
Palazzo dei Consoli, like the unfinished Palazzo Pretorio, was built during the first half of the 14th century, a period of great expansion of the town. In fact, the need for adequate public space, in compliance with the political and economic power Gubbio exercised on the surrounding territory by then, was keenly felt. So, the ancient Platea Communis, that used to be slightly higher up on the hill, was abandoned and the splendid terrace was realized to absolve the role of a directional center that bordered with but was external to all the neighborhoods, thereby maintaining an independent and impartial standing in political matters."

An Accademia, expressly constituted by the nobles of Gubbio for this purpose, promoted and financed—starting from 1713—the construction of the Teatro Comunale of Gubbio. Of more modest size than the current theaters, it was inaugurated during the period of the Carnival of 1738. But, structural problems started to come out: in 1840 a forty year period of work of restoration began, there was a complete inversion of the positions of the stage and parterre stalls, the construction of the atrium and annexed rooms and the building of a new façade. The new theater was inaugurated in 1862, and in addition to the structural work, the work of decorating and all furniture and fittings were executed, not exclusively but mainly, by the major Egubin artists of the time. Among them, the decoration of the audience hall of Raffaele Antonioli and the gilded chandelier with the Bohemia crystals are both outstanding. Declared not fit for use in 1961, it was restored again from 1975 to 24 March 1985, when it inaugurated a new life."

&#13;
The Teatro della Concordia is located in the heart of the ancient center of Monte Castello di Vibio, a small town standing on the right side of the Tiber River Valley, not far from Todi.&#13;
The theater, with its 99 seats—stalls and seats inside the boxes in total—is known as “the smallest theater in the world”. In a document of the time one can read: “it was built of this size because of the size of its burgh”.&#13;
It was designed in the full post-French-Revolution period, and took the name of the same “concord between people” that was going to be recreated in Europe at the beginning of the 19th century. Built thanks to the financing of nine illustrious families of the village, who did everything possible to make it a place of meetings and fun, it was inaugurated in 1808.&#13;
Restructured at the end of the same century, in 1892, it was frescoed by Luigi Allegretti—at the time only 14 years old—son of Cesare Allegretti, a Perugian painter who had already painted the decoration of the stage curtain and backdrop of the theater. In 1914, 36 stalls—today 37—were installed in the parterre. Unfortunately the theater was closed in 1951, and some time in the 1960s the ceiling collapsed. The work of recovery of the original wooden structures, which support the boxes ended in 1993. In 1997, the “smallest theater in the world” entered into a “twin” relationship with the Teatro Farnese of Parma, the “largest theater in the world”, which has four thousand seats.&#13;
In 1929, the young soprano singer Antonietta Stella of Todi, who would later become one of the best interpreters of the repertory of the Maestro Giuseppe Verdi, sang on this stage. In 1945, this theater saw the beginning of the career of another celebrity, the then very young Gina Lollobrigida; in fact she performed here in the role of the Santarellina, a comedy of Eduardo Scarpetta, mise–en scène and directed by Tenneroni, an Artistic Director and Manager from Todi."

The Teatro di Monteleone di Spoleto is located between three small squares, Piazza Plebiscito, Piazza San Francesco and Piazza del Mercato. It faces the Civic Tower and the Church of San Francesco.&#13;
A “small theater” in Monteleone is mentioned in a document of 1834, it is recorded in the Gregorian Public Register as a municipal seat for the year 1918. In fact, today the small theater is part of the ambitious plan of the Umbria Region Heritage recovery and enhancement program, which also includes historical theaters, built in small and isolated villages, as evidence of their great vitality. In Monteleone di Spoleto, a Filodrammatica association was founded, at the beginning of the 1900s that operated to make the audience hall of the theater functional up to the first years after the Second World War. In the 1950s the theater was transformed into a “Cinema”—a movie theater—named “Cin Cine” and inaugurated with the screening of a black and white movie: “Torna a Sorrento” of Carlo Ludovico Bragaglia. &#13;
The 1979 earthquake that violently hit the eastern Apennine dorsal of Umbra, and in particular the Valnerina Valley, offered the opportunity to restore—after twenty years of abandonment—the already heavily damaged small theater. Today the theater has been brought back to the community as a multifunctional audience hall for cultural activities, where the theatrical activities are hosted in the upper floor of the building. It possesses 80 seats and its interiors are completely renewed, in fact the original furniture and fittings—including its wooden gallery, a historical 19th century-like-theatrical manufacture—were definitively lost with the earthquake."

The Teatro Civico is located in the historical center of Norcia, in Piazza Vittorio Veneto, at a short distance from Corso Sertorio.&#13;
The Theater was built in 1876, on a design of the Perugian Domenico Mollajoli, which foresaw a horseshoe-shaped audience hall with three overlooking orders of boxes and a loggia.&#13;
The inauguration took place on 15 August 1876, with the execution of “Un ballo in maschera”—A Masked Ball—of Giuseppe Verdi. On this occasion, in order to pay for the organization of the event, the municipal administration deliberated to borrow 15.000 Lire. The stage curtain was executed by the Venetian G. Zasso and had as its subject Quintus Sertorius on a Battlefield in Africa. The building underwent some restoration work in 1950, but unfortunately, after only two years of existence, a fire destroyed it—and with it—the curtain was lost too. After a long period of restoration work, concluded in 1995, the Theater has returned to a new life and is functioning perfectly.&#13;

6965,108118,traduzioni_descrizione,en,"Caporali Theater&#13;
The Teatro Caporali is inside the historical center of the burgh of Panicale. It deserves a visit for both the elegance of its internal structure, which is richly decorated, and the quality of performances held on its venue. In fact, the Theater hosts the Prose Season (TSU Circuit), Music Concerts “Insieme Panicale”, The Baroque Opera, Ballet performances and numerous Conventions. The history of the Theater has its roots in the “Società Filodrammatica”, an association founded in 1694 by a group of youth from Panicale. In 1786 the “Società Filodrammatica” fused with a new society, the “Accademia Teatrale”. This Academy commissioned the construction of a small wooden theater to F. Tarducci, and this was called “Teatro del Sole”—theater of the sun—due to its location.&#13;
In 1856, because of its progressive degradation, the Theater was enlarged, modified, and given a new shape.&#13;
The restoration plan was entrusted to the architect Giovanni Caproni, who modified the structure by widening the stage, increasing the number of the boxes and building a beautiful loggia with a casted iron rail over them.&#13;
The Perugian Alceste Ricci was commissioned for its decoration. The design foresaw the painting of its wooden structure with a light color and the application of gilded stucco decorations and festoons. The painter Mariano Piervittori, instead, painted the main curtain of the stage, the one depicting the Captain of Venture Boldrino Panieri di Panicale Receiving the Keys of Perugia.&#13;
The audience hall became elegant and harmonious, and was opened to the public during the Carnival period of 1858, with its new denomination Teatro Cesare Caporali. Restored in the 1980s, the theater has come back to its full activity."

Palazzo dei Priori is the historical palace that stands at the corner of Piazza IV Novembre and Corso Vannucci, in Perugia.&#13;
It was the seat of the Priori— i.e. outstanding citizens—the highest political authority of the town in medieval communes, and as such it was decorated in the course of the years by the best artists of the time.&#13;
A first nucleus of constructions, dating back to the 1270s, was already built. Starting from the last decade of the 13th century, the “palatium novum populi” began to develop around the architectural complex of private property. Its execution would be terminated in subsequent stages, resulting in an irregular architectural body, rich with asymmetries and movement. &#13;
A first nucleus of the palace, built between 1293 and 1297, is defined by the three trifore—the three-lancet mullioned windows—on the second floor above the portal overlooking the square, and the ten trifore overlooking Corso Vannucci. During the first expansion—1333-1337—two trifore next to the portal and a straight staircase were added to the façade facing the square. The straight staircase was a work of Ambrogio Maitani, while the semicircular staircase we see today dates from 1902. Later on, the volume to the right was added encompassing the pre-existing Church of San Severo della Piazza, preferring to have a portico with irregular arches.&#13;
In 1353, the palace construction extended to the current Via dei Priori. The building extension continued in the next century with a bridging arch bypassing Via dei Priori, also encompassing a medieval tower. A further extension was added on, between 1429 and 1443.&#13;
Walking up the stairs facing the square, entering inside, through the Gothic-arched portal surmounted by copies of the 13th century bronzes of the Griffin and the Lion—the original symbols of the town are kept inside the palace—one enters into the Sala dei Notari, the Hall of the Notaries’ Guild. Originally the hall of the popular assemblies, it is a rectangular vaulted room supported by eight huge Romanesque arches, and is entirely frescoed depicting legends, tales and Biblical stories that can be dated from the last decade of the 13th century—probably the work of the Master of Farneto and the Master Expressionist of Santa Chiara—and with coats of arms of the Podestà and the various Captains of the People, who governed the town. &#13;
The façade on Corso Vannucci, apart from presenting the trifore and the quadrifore—four-lancet mullioned windows—that lighten the heavy body-mass of the wall, has a rich round arched portal, probably dating from the 14th century, sided by pilasters supported by Lions where allegoric representations are featured: on the left pilaster Magnanimity, Fertility and Pride; on the right pilaster, Greed, Opulence and Humility. Two Griffins surmount the pilasters and both subjugate Calves, which symbolize the Guild of the Butchers, who commissioned the work, while Scenes of the life of Man are represented on the arch. In the lunette, there are copies of the statues of SS Louis of Toulouse, Lawrence and Herculanus, the originals are kept in the National Gallery of Umbria.&#13;
On the First Floor of the palace, seat of the Municipality, there are several frescoes. Those of Bernardino Pinturicchio, in the Council Hall, are especially noteworthy. On the Third Floor, seat of the National Gallery of Umbria, there is the Priori Chapel, frescoed by Benedetto Bonfigli with Stories from the Life of St Louis of Toulouse and St Herculanus (1454-1480).&#13;
In the same building, along Corso Vannucci, there is the Collegio del Cambio—the seat of the Guild of the Moneychangers that conserves precious frescoes executed between 1498 and 1500 by Pietro Vannucci, called il Perugino, one of the highest exemplifications of the Renaissance Italian Art—and the Collegio della Mercanzia—the seat of the Guild of the Merchants—inside an elegant room all covered with wooden panels of carved poplar wood, probably the work of some craftsmen from transalpine countries."

&#13;
The construction of the theater began in 1718 and concluded in 1723; the promoters of this initiative were a group of Perugian nobles, who felt the necessity of a more suitable and more spacious place to hold theatric representations than the then existing theaters in Perugia. This theater was completely built in wood and named Teatro della Nobile Accademia del Casino—Theater of the Noble Academy of the Casino—with its four orders of boxes and a squared floor plan, which soon proved to be unsuitable for the new needs of melodrama and comedy representation. The Academy, therefore, decided to demolish it (1765) and commissioned its reconstruction to the architect Pietro Carattoli. The new floor plan was inspired by the Teatro Argentina of Rome and had a horseshoe-shaped brickwork structure with 82 boxes distributed in four orders, of which the lower one was supported by small columns and provided with a richly decorated balustrade.&#13;
The front of the parapet of the boxes was embellished with painted stuccowork cameos by Carlo Spiridone Mariotti. The theater took the name of Teatro Pavone—the Peacock—after the beautiful bird sacred to the Roman goddess Juno, depicted in triumph on the stage curtain painted by Francesco Appiani, an artist from Ancona, in 1772.&#13;
The decoration on the ceiling and the substitution of the consumed stage curtain with a work depicting The Rebuilding of Perugia Ordered by the Emperor Augustus are both the work of the Roman painter Gaspare Coccia, and date from 1814. In 1856 there was considerable work of restoration, which involved the ceiling vault and reconstruction of the roof, the introduction of a plastered ceiling—cannicciata—even in the fourth and fifth orders of boxes, and the consequent transformation of the latter into the upper loggia. The new decoration of the entire theater and stage curtain was commissioned to Nicola Benvenuti."

&#13;
In the second half of the 18th century, among the nine Theaters existing in Perugia, the Sapienza Vecchia bore the name and the role of the Teatro Nazionale dell’Accademia di Belle Lettere ed Arti, distinguishing itself for its rich annual repertory of opera and prose works, both Italian and foreign.&#13;
Hosted in the monumental building of the Sapienza, which in 1362 was the first University College in Italy, the theater probably hosted the first acting of the young Carlo Goldoni—who followed his father, personal practitioner of a noble Perugian family—in the role of Mirandolina. The theater underwent some restructuring work in the first half of the 19th century that saw the building of a new wing on the northern side to host the large stage and scenic machinery, reproducing the same typology as the large lyric theaters like La Scala of Milan on a smaller scale.&#13;
At that time an elegant gallery was built together with a gas illumination system. The decorations of the Audience Hall and of the Sala Rossa—Red Hall—next to it were commissioned to the Perugian painters Lemmo Rossi Scotti and Matteo Tassi."

&#13;
The Teatro Morlacchi, the major theater in town, is in the historical center of Perugia, in Piazza Morlacchi, next to the University Faculty of Literature and Philosophy.&#13;
 In 1777, the Perugian bourgeoisie, animated by Annibale Mariotti, decided to build a new theater in emulation of the nobles, who had built their own theater, the Teatro Pavone. It was with this intent that ninety families constituted an association, the “Society for the construction of a new theater”, and bought an old convent previously occupied by some nuns and confided the project to the Perugian architect Alessio Lorenzini. Lorenzini endowed the Theater with a horseshoe-shaped floor plan and five orders of boxes for an audience total capacity of one thousand and two hundred seats.&#13;
The ceiling and the stage curtain were decorated by Baldassarre Orsini, while Carlo Spiridone Mariotti executed the sixteen cameos of the vault and the medallions with Icarus sacrificing to Bacchus the Poetic Drama, Tragedy, Comedy and the Pastoral Drama; Giovanni Cappelli decorated the parapets of the boxes and painted a Bacchic scene on the proscenium ceiling, while the stuccowork was executed by Giovanni Battista Cronici. In 1874, the theater was completely renewed and reopened to the public with the performance of the Aida. The work of restructuring was done by Francesco Moretti, Matteo Tassi, Lucio Angeloni and the architect Guglielmo Calderini, while Mariano Piervitori executed a new allegorical representation depicting Arts and Literature on the ceiling, and Tempera-painted the stage curtain with a local historical theme illustrating the Return of Biordo Michelotti to Perugia in 1398.&#13;
Morlacchi Theater has hosted many high level actors, like Irma Gramatica, Virgilio Talli, and Oreste Calabrese. Its activity had been constant up to the beginning of the 20th century, but suffered a decay period under the years of fascism, to the point of being subjected to requisition by the German troops during their occupation of the town in World War II, who used it for performances for their soldiers. At the end of the war, the theater was severely damaged, therefore the Municipality—to which it was handed over between 1951 and 1953—financed the work of restoration, which consisted of the remaking of the roof and ceiling and modifying the stage, the orchestra pit and the marble floors of the atrium and foyer.&#13;
Currently the Theater audience has a total of 785 seats available. The stage is 20 meters wide and 10,5 meters long. Its proscenium is 10,5 meters wide.&#13;
Francesco Giuseppe Baldassarre Morlacchi (Perugia, 14 June 1784-Innsbruck, 28 October 1841)—to whom the Theater is dedicated—was an Italian opera composer and one of the main personalities responsible for the spreading of Italian opera abroad."

Villa Colle del Cardinale is the most well known of the Umbrian Villas. Named after its first owner, a Cardinal, it stands imposingly on the hill dominating the narrow valley of the Caina riverbank, at the foot of the western side of Mount Tezio, near Perugia.&#13;
The complex dominates the countryside from the heights of a terracing and occupies the entire Hill of the Cardinal, which is quite probably of archaeological importance. Rich in water and secret aqueducts, it towers over the valley that led towards the roads to the sea and the land ruled by the Vitelli and the Montefeltro.&#13;
The Cardinal Fulvio Della Corgna1, commissioned the work of construction of this edifice that was probably designed around 1557, as a magnificent Summer Residence responding to the Renaissance concept of a “place of delight”. Probably, the Cardinal personally requested the architect Galeazzo Alessi, who was the favorite designer of the powerful family.&#13;
The nephew of the Cardinal, Diomede Della Penna, adopted by him, inherited the residence before the extinction of the family, and before the villa was sold in 1644 to the Oddi, at the time already Oddi-Baglioni, who transformed it—in the second half of the 19th century—into an important literary saloon that would remain as such with the successive families of the Cesaroni and the Parodi.&#13;
The palace appears as a compact block with a rectangular floor plan set on a terracing. It also has a basement with large rooms that are crossed by the gallery for the access of coaches. The importance of the main façade is underlined by the arched and rusticated Entrance Portal, with a flight of steps leading to it, and the balcony of the Salon d’Honneur that opens above it, where there is a large window that is higher and more inwardly set than the others.&#13;
Inside, the Villa has a magnificent Grand Staircase, a central Salon d’Honneur with a richly adorned coffered wooden ceiling and richly decorated walls.&#13;
The frescoes of the Villa were executed by Salvio Savini, in 1581, the favorite painter of the Della Corgna. Further decorations are of Leopardi and Labruzzi.&#13;
The complex has several annexes, such as the Warden and the Gardener House, the Lemon-house, the Greenhouse for Orchids and four Hunting Lodges.&#13;
The burgh, once a service area for the Villa, stands at the far southern end of the complex. The green area is organized around the access drive going up the hill. The 16th century setting underwent significant transformations in the 17th and the 18th century and so the visual impact is Baroque. On the left of the Villa there is the Winter Garden, which is set on three levels and connected by a flight of stairs, while on the right there is the English Garden, modified in the second half of the 19th century—main entrance, the large square with the Erin fountain and the lake with its islands—and enriched with new plants.&#13;
The Villa has been the property of the Ministero dei Beni Culturali since 1996, and together with the Lemon-house is used as the venue for Congresses and Events.&#13;

&#13;
The structure of the Museo Paleontologico di Pietrafitta, built expressly for this purpose, with its 3000 square meters displays one of the largest collections, at a European level, of fossil finds of mammals, reptiles, amphibians and insects dating back from the Lower Pleistocene, 1,6-1,4 million years ago. The remnants of large mammals are exhibited in the “cradles”—this is what the nucleus supporting the fossils still encapsulated in the material in which they were found are called—surrounded by an arrangement with a didactic and communicative purpose. The finds are only partially restored and it will continue to be done even inside the museum, where a laboratory for this purpose is foreseen.&#13;
The fossils come from the large deposits of Lignite, which are at a short distance from the museum, and the name of the museum honors the memory of the first mineworker who collected and saved the important discovery from destruction. &#13;
The mine activity developed in the Basin of Pietrafitta—with its heritage of “industrial archaeology” intended not only as a history of the work and machinery used, but also, or rather mainly, the history of the fortunes that happened to the individuals who worked in the mines, therefore a social history of a particular industrial and geographical environment—constitutes a further element confirming once again the cultural importance of the area."

It is an elegant construction in Neoclassical style, built in 1787 on a design of Alessio Lorenzini, characterized by a horseshoe-shaped floor plan with three orders of boxes for a total audience capacity of 200 seats. The interior decoration of both painting and stuccowork is noteworthy and quotes ancient Latin mottoes. &#13;

The Villa is located at a short distance from the historical center of Spello, in proximity of the Roman amphitheater and the Romanesque Church of San Claudio. The ancient Roman settlement, on which the Villa stands, is a large sanctuary area, where the so-called Temple of Venus, the Theater and the Thermal Bath are collocated.&#13;
The early constructions of the Villa were raised, in the 16th century, by the Counts Acuti Urbani of San Lorenzo. In the 18th century the Villa passes to Donna Teresa Pamphili Grillo, who takes cares of transforming and expanding the residence built by the Urbani, and planting the Italian Garden. At her death, the property initially goes to the Counts Sperelli, and later, to the wealthy landowner Gregorio Piermarini, who carried out significant transformations and expansions, between 1805 and 1830. After alternated fortunes, in 1923, the Villa is acquired by the engineer Decio Costanzi, who fragmented the complex by selling the ancient portion to a missionary institution, the Suore Missionarie d’Egitto, and the remaining portion, including the Hunting Lodge, the Gardens and the annexed buildings, to the Provincia di Perugia.&#13;
The most relevant aspect of the Villa is the extraordinary external arrangement originating the Vesuvian Garden at the entrance, the riding track—galoppatoio—the Italian Garden and the Park with the Cypress Grove. The Vesuvian Garden or Baroque, located near the entrance, is audaciously designed on a steep slope that leads to the Service Lodge entrance portal. Delimited, on the longer sides, by a double row of majestic Cypresses, the garden is formed by roundish terracing connected to each other by sinuous staircases, alternated with short spaces of grass and boxwood hedges, skillfully pruned and modeled into singular forms. Protagonist of the composition is the beautiful Exedra Fountain, placed in a central position with the statue of Diana, the goddess of the hunt, composition closed at the summit by the elegant Wing, hiding a cistern, adorned with niches and surmounted by a clock. Juxtaposed to this singular garden, a wide riding track with a circensian shape was built in the 20th century.&#13;
The Italian Garden is older, dating back to the 18th century, and is set behind the Hunting Lodge. The garden has a rectangular shape, is narrow and more than 150 meters long. Currently it is subdivided into four main flowerbeds, double bordered with boxwood edges, each one of them subdivided in their turn into four smaller parts. The grassy parterres inside were once totally occupied with roses. A large quantity of citrus vases adorns the edges of the garden that is rich with their heady perfumes in spring. The uphill edges are tree-lined with Cypresses, the main protagonists of the composition, which also includes the beautiful Park and the thick Holm-oak grove.&#13;
Queen Giovanna and King Boris of Bulgaria were hosted in Villa Fidelia during their honeymoon in 1930.&#13;
Following a by now decennial tradition, Villa Fidelia hosts Theatrical performances, Concerts, Opera and Musical Events in its Park. It has been the seat of Temporary Exhibitions since 2003."

Palazzo Collicola is located in the homonym square—Piazza Collicola—expressly realized at the beginning of the 17th century to create space for the sumptuous and noble residence.&#13;
In the same period, other squares with their respective palaces characterized the urban planning of Spoleto, such as Piazza Rosari, Piazza Ancaiani, Piazza Della Genga and Piazza Pianciani, to name some.&#13;
The building was designed by the Roman architect Sebastiano Cipriani and its construction lasted from 1717 to 1730.&#13;
The first prominent figure of the family was Taddeo Collicola, personal physician of Pope Urban VIII during the first half of the 17th century.&#13;
The fortunes of this family, who came from Montesanto, near Sellano, grew in the next century.&#13;
The palace hosted illustrious figures such as Charles III of Spain in 1734, Pope Pius VI in 1782 and King Charles Emmanuel IV of Sardinia in 1801.&#13;
When the family disappeared, the edifice was acquired by the Municipality in 1932, and today it hosts the museums of Palazzo Collicola Arti Visive e Museo Caradente dedicated respectively to visual arts and sculptures. The façade of the building is plain and divided horizontally by three orders of windows, corresponding to the internal floors. The backside has undergone serious alterations; only some of the original trees, part of the Italian Garden, have survived. The interior has been striped of its luxurious furnishings, which came from the inheritance left by Christine of Sweden; the Piano Nobile—main floor—is decorated with the 18th century paintings of Liborio Coccetti."

&#13;
The Teatro Caio Melisso is in the historical center of Spoleto, in the suggestive scenery of Piazza del Duomo, on the artificial terracing at the foot of Colle Sant’Elia.&#13;
The current Theater descends from the oldest theater in Spoleto, the Teatro Nobile, which has undergone several transformations. The construction work started in 1657, when the Accademia degli Ottusi succeeded in obtaining a space in an extremely interesting urban location, between the Opera del Duomo and the Church of Santa Maria della Manna d’Oro.&#13;
Finely decorated, it contains interesting 19th century paintings executed by the Perugian artist Domenico Bruschi.&#13;
Its unusual location, in Piazza del Duomo, makes the visit more suggestive.&#13;
The current features of the Theater are the result of the design of Giovanni Montiroli, who—between 1877-1880—modified the horseshoe-shaped curve of the audience hall to improve the vision of the stage for the public, and built the three orders of boxes, tearing down the old wooden structures.&#13;
The Perugian painter Domenico Bruschi decorated the ceiling, featuring Apollo and The Nine Muses, alternated with floral decorations in the lunettes, overlooked by monochromatic putti, while he painted The Apotheosis of Gaius Melissus on the stage curtain.&#13;
The Theater is entitled to Gaius Melissus—freedman friend of Gaius Maecenas—from Spoleto, who was the trusted librarian of the Emperor Augustus, writer, playwright and grammarian. After a long period of abandonment, the Theater was restored in 1958, on the occasion of the first edition of the Festival dei Due Mondi—The Festival of the Two Worlds—with a complete revision of all its fundamental structures.&#13;
The interest for any form of theater has always been very alive in Spoleto to the point that, in the 17th century, it produced a number of playwrights, among them Campello, Castelli, Lauri, Luparini and Vittori, not counting Giovanni Gherardi, the progenitor of one of the most famous genealogies of Harlequin comedians and comics of the Commedia dell’Arte.&#13;
In 1817, Gioacchino Rossini performed the drama L’Italiana in Algeri, playing the double bass, barely having the time to admire its 18th century decorations, which were partly destroyed and partly stolen soon after, in 1819, by some unknown “Florentines”."

&#13;
The Teatro Nuovo of Spoleto is in the historical center of the town.&#13;
The town Municipality deliberated its construction on 13 February 1846, believing the “Teatro Antico Augusto” was “indecent and deaf”. The work lasted almost twenty years, and the townspeople tried to accelerate its completion, even by setting on fire the then “Teatro Nobile”, now Caio Mellisso. The new theater was solemnly inaugurated on 3 August 1864. It is a building characterized by a horseshoe-shaped floor plan with four orders of boxes.&#13;
The Teatro Nuovo design is of the architect Ireneo Aleardi, also author of the Sphaeristerium of Macerata and the theaters of Ascoli and San Severino. Instead, Luigi Masella was commissioned for the stucco decoration work and the painting of the audience hall and the stage curtain. The Roman painter Carlo Bazzani executed the so-called Comodino—the curtain of service—while Pietro Recanatini painted the scenes of historical character and Eugenio Venier was in charge of the management of the stage machinery.&#13;
The slowing down of the work was also due to some legal complaints about the curtain execution, which at the end was commissioned to Francesco Colghetti, an artist from Bergamo. In the meantime, the grandiose gilded chandelier sketch arrived from Paris and the wall clock for the scenic arch was ordered. Finally, it was the turn of the execution of the stuccowork on the façade and the medallions with the portraits of The Maestros of Music, which were commissioned to the sculptor Biagioli."

The suburban complex of Villa Redenta is located to the north of Spoleto, in an area transformed by the urban expansion, in the aftermath of World War II. It is easily reachable from the historical center, and at the same time immersed in a splendid Park, which is currently public.&#13;
It was the Orsini family that built the Villa in the 17th century, on top of a Roman edifice, of which some remnants are preserved. The property later passes over to the Locatelli from Cesena, to whom the current aspect of the Villa is due—probably on a design commissioned to the architect Pietro Ferrari. Some adjustments are made between the 18th and early 19th century, when the Redenta changes owners again and passes under the Marignoli who modify the appurtenances, giving the garden its current aspect. Having been temporarily handed over to Pope Leo XII, when the property returns to the Marignoli it takes the name of “Redenta”, i.e. the redeemed. Currently the Villa is owned by the Provincia di Perugia. The Farm has been re-adapted as a Hostel and the Stables as a multifunctional hall. The main structure, the rectangular building directly overlooking the street, is prolonged on both sides by the annexes that contribute to forming the wall surrounding the property. The centrality of the building is evidenced by the central position of the arched portal of access, surmounted by a balcony laid on corbels, on the main façade of two floors. The façade on the opposite side, the one with three floors that overlooks the Park, is given a higher importance with the presence of the two squared lateral towers at the corners and the portico—formed by three arches in rusticated brickwork—on the Ground Floor. Up on the roof, decorative corbels enrich the important and protruding cornice, a decorative pattern that is repeated on the roof of the towers. Inside, the atrium decorated with figures of Napoleonic soldiers and marble busts of the Popes that have been hosted in the Villa and the rooms with frescoed or coffered ceilings, are remarkable.&#13;
On the sides of the Villa, the complex is completed with both the 18th century horseshoe-shaped building, which hosts the chapel and overlooks the Secret Garden, and the Baroque “Coffee House” on the opposite side with the small Doric Temple, the Farm and the Stables a little further on. Axis and Symmetry are the distinctive characteristics of the Park. The large basin with the central obelisk and the small Neoclassical Temple, a little further back, correspond to the axis of the Villa. Around the basin there is the vast grassy parterre framed by Boxwoods and Laurel edges. Next to the small Temple a Park of Holm oaks opens where there is a rocky fountain, small lake, sundial, Icehouse, oval basin and a Roman earthenware floor."

Todi’s Palazzo del Capitano, also called Palazzo Nuovo, stands on the eastern side of Piazza del Popolo, next to Palazzo del Popolo, which stands a little further back. A large staircase joins them; today the palaces are the seats of the Municipal Council and Municipal Museums.&#13;
Palazzo del Capitano was built in 1293 and was originally separated from the contiguous Palazzo del Popolo by a road that was later closed and covered.&#13;
In 1518, the vaults on the ground floor were walled up and re-opened only relatively recently. Instead, the entrance door on the top of the staircase dates back to the 1940s.&#13;
On the ground floor, behind the staircase leading to Palazzo del Popolo, two large round arches lead to the so-called voltoni—big vaults—a portico used as an atrium.  &#13;
Above the voltoni, the three Gothic windows on the first floor stand out for their elegance. These are similar in style to some medieval Venetian edifices—apart from being similar to the windows of the second floor of Palazzo dei Priori in Perugia—each one consists of three lancet windows, with a circular motif in the tracery superimposed by a tympana, which provides light for the Hall of the Capitano del Popolo—Capitan of the People—a large room in which there are remnants of frescoes from the 14th century. On the same floor there is the Civic Museum archaeological collection that preserves archaeological finds found in the Tuderte territory. &#13;
On the highest floor there are four other three-lancet-windows, each one surmounted by a round arch, that provides light for the Municipal Art Gallery.&#13;
If Palazzo del Capitano of Todi is built in Gothic style and is characterized by a great harmony of its decorative elements, however, its main attractiveness is due to the important Museum collection it features inside.&#13;
On the first floor there is the Hall of the Capitano del Popolo, with its frescoes dated from the 14th century, facing Palazzo del Popolo’s General Council Hall. On the last floor, of both buildings, the Municipal Art Gallery is arranged. This Museum has gone through a very recent reorganization and includes many sections. The Municipal Heritage consists of two main nucleuses: the first comes from the Napoleonic requisitions, and the second from the suppression of religious corporations. To these a third is added with the archaeological collection of the early 1900s."

The Teatro Comunale of Todi is right in the historical center, behind Piazza Grande, as a reminder of the important role it played during the 19th century.&#13;
In fact, on 3 September 1868, the Municipal Assembly commissioned the building of the new theater to Carlo Gatteschi, an architect from the town of Arezzo, who had already built a remarkable theater, the Teatro Signorelli of Cortona. The work of construction was terminated in 1872, but it was inaugurated four years later with the representation of the opera Un ballo in maschera—A Masked Ball—of Giuseppe Verdi. The audience hall had a horseshoe-shaped floor plan and four orders of boxes for a total capacity of about 500 seats. The stuccowork with the portraits featuring illustrious personalities was executed by the Studio Angeletti and Biscarini of Perugia, while their gilding was the work of Giosuè and Daniele Lumaconi, the fresco paintings on the ceiling and the parapet of the boxes was executed by Matteo Tassi and Alfonso Morganti. The stage curtain was painted by Annibale Brugnoli (Perugia, 1843-1915).&#13;
In 1894, for the first time an early motion film picture, titled “Un bagno di ragazzi”, was shown there.&#13;
After a period of decline, the theater and the rooms annexed to it were restored, from 1982 to 1992, when it was reopened to the public with a full capacity of 499 seats."

The Teatro Clitunno stands on the homonym square, in the historical center of Trevi.&#13;
This theater undoubtedly deserves a visit for the elegance of its venue, the interior decorations and its stage curtain, both executed on a design of Domenico Bruschi, but also for the stage plays periodically presented in it.&#13;
The current Theater was built on a design of the architect Domenico Mollaioli, to replace the by then crumbling old Teatro Clitunno, which had been hosted inside the Municipal Palace since the 17th century.&#13;
The work started in 1874 and was concluded thanks to the funds of the municipality and of private families, who thus assured their families their own private box during the stage-play. The curtain, signed and dated 1877 and painted by the artist Domenico Bruschi, depicts The Emperor Caligula Paying Tribute to the God Clitumnus. On the basis of his sketches the ceiling, the scaffolding and the proscenium decoration were also executed.&#13;
In 1877, the building could finally be inaugurated with the representation of the opera Maria di Rohan of the composer Donizzetti.&#13;
For almost a century, the Teatro Clitunno was at the center of the cultural, social and recreational activities of the town, until 1955, when with minor interventions it was transformed into a movie theater.&#13;
A slow decline of the cinematographic halls had initiated, however, it was stopped by the general plan of restoration of the building carried out, during the years 1987-1993, by the municipality.&#13;

Completely immersed in the typical Umbrian landscape full of olive trees, overlooking the rolling hills between Assisi and Spoleto, the 16th century Villa Fabri stands in the middle of the hill, right outside Porta del Lago of Trevi. &#13;
It was Girolamo Fabri who had the Villa built, “for the solace of his old age, and the joy of the posterity of the village”, at the end of the 16th century. In 1891, it was bought at first by the Bohemian Council, and then passed over to the Ethiopian Council. In 2000, with the purchase of the Villa by the Trevi Municipality, the course of its history has changed. It is also because of its recent “affiliation” to the European Garden Heritage Network-EGHN that the Villa has become the seat of the Rete Regionale Ville, Parchi e Giardini dell'Osservatorio Regionale per la Biodiversità e il Paesaggio Rurale— the Regional Network of Villas, Parks and Gardens for biodiversity and rural landscape.&#13;
The building assumes its form in the main body and in the wing added by the Bohemians. The Main Floor is recognizable by the three large central arches and the aedicule-windows. The facades are finely decorated with graffiti depicting figures of Bohemian Angels and Saints and, on the northern side, by the View of Bohemian Towns. Such decorations date back to 1912 and 1914, and are the work of B. Cila and of the Benedictine Abbot Pantaleo Mayor.&#13;
The interior of the villa is also very well kept, starting from the very entrance, the atrium, it preserves more than one frescoed room, suggestive places rich with allegorical figures, and the chapel, frescoed by Cila and the Abbot Pantaleo Mayor. It represents an interesting and almost the only Italian example of the school of Beuron, a Swedish artistic movement that developed during the mid-19th century and was inspired by Egyptian, Greek, Roman and Byzantine painting models.&#13;
The Garden of the Villa is set on three grassy terracings. To the southeast, they are framed by a vast Olive Tree grove—called Chiusa—from where the Exravirgin of Olive Oil is produced. &#13;
And it is right from this same direction that it is possible to admire the most imposing and suggestive façade of the complex, especially the double staircase in stone located between the second and third level, with a nymphaeum and three large niches, of which the central one is enriched with Sculpted Atlases."

The Teatro dei Riuniti—together with the remake of the square, the construction of the clock tower, and the project for the realization of a bridge over the Royal Palace—was part of the urban renewal of the town during the first decade of the 19th century. The design for the realization of the theater, which foresaw three orders of boxes, 13 each, an audience hall and a spacious stage—dressing rooms included—was commissioned in 1805 to Giovanni Cerrini, architect formed at the Accademia Perugina. Between 1810 and 1812 the fresco paintings—brought to light recently—were executed by the Perugian painter Giovanni Monotti and Faina. There are two stripes of decorations along the second and third order of boxes, with the portraits of illustrious playwrights and authors of drama, framed by laurel and alternated with swans and panoplies in the first order, and by lyres, crowns, trumpets and oak leaves in the second order. The theater, restructured several times, underwent an enlargement of the stalls area in 1959-1960 that penalized the stage area. Although the decoration of the theater of Umbertide is fragmented and partly repainted, it is the sole—among the ones in Umbria—to have survived the post-Unitarian remake. This fact confers to the theater a higher value, being a rare evidence of what the interior design of Neoclassical taste was like.&#13;
In 1985 the Umbertide Municipality decided to restore the Teatro dei Riuniti, by taking the 19th century design as a reference and adding some functional decorative elements to be commissioned to contemporary artists and designers. The theater was given back completely restored to the townspeople of Umbertide in 1990, and has become an important point of cultural referral of the town and a natural seat for the homonym theatric company, born in 1985."

Villa Cahen was built by the rich financier of Aversa, Edouard Cahen, who in the last quarter of the 19th century had acquired a vast estate between the two slopes of the Paglia River from the Bourbon del Monte. Cahen, conferred title of Marquis from Vittorio Emanuele II for outstanding merits earned during the war of Unification, had already had a deteriorated castle rebuilt to make it his home, in the nearby Torre Alfina.&#13;
Today the Villa is included in the protected area of Allerona-Meana. A refined example of Art Nouveau, the edifice is in large part surrounded by an Italian Garden, rich with rare herbaceous species of plants and trees that arrived here thanks to the passion of the previous owner. Between the Italian Garden, the Greenhouse and the Orangery, there is also the recently restored Japanese Garden. The Villa has various floors: a basement, used as a deposit and service rooms for electrical and heating systems; a ground floor for the halls and the studio, as the spacious and exclusive reception hall and dining room; a third floor for the bedrooms and services reserved for the owners; and finally, the last floor with the rooms for the servants."

The Castello d’Alviano—located on a hill on the left side of the Tiber River, between Orvieto and Amelia—is at the origins of the development of the urban nucleus of the Municipality of Alviano.&#13;
The castle structure conforms to the morphology of the land, which has determined its trapezoidal shaped floor plan. It develops on four levels, attic included; around the perimeter of its surrounding wall there are four towers, one for each corner. At the entrance of the castle, placed on the façade, there is a Stock Lion and a Head of Medusa; which symbolize the Fief of Alviano.&#13;
The castle was built by Count Offredo, the progenitor of the Alviano family, in 996 A.D.. The members of this family gained importance and, with time, accumulated more and more powerful positions, succeeding in holding the castle until 1308, when they were thrown out by the Amerine Guelphs.&#13;
The manor returned into the hands of the family thanks to Francesco D’Alviano, who made it his residence, until the Chiaravalle destroyed it. Its reconstruction, in 1495, is due to his son Bartolomeo.&#13;
The new structure was built as a magnificent baronial residence, with some of its rooms decorated by Giovanni Antonio de’ Sacchis, called Pordenone. Being a military architect, Bartolomeo D’Alviano took protective measures, such as that of equipping the castle structure with defensive bodies, strategically positioned, following the rules of military architecture established by Leon Battista Alberti.&#13;
In 1500 his son Bernardino, an expert in casting techniques, transformed it into one of the most important fortress-foundries for cannons of Umbria.&#13;
Lacking male descendants, in 1543, the Alviano family lost the fief and changed their name to Liviani.&#13;
Since then, having lost its military importance, the fortress has changed owners several times: starting from the Marquis Raimondy from Genoa, it became property of Donna Olimpia Maidalchini, wife of Pamfilo Pamphilj Landi, in the 17th century, and lastly, for descent, it was inherited by Prince Don Andrea II Doria Pamphilj Landi, in 1816.&#13;
The fortress is in pure Renaissance style characterized by a beautiful internal court—Ward of Honor—and a portico with a loggia, which numerous fine rooms overlook. Among these, the San Francesco Chapel, with its fine17th century frescoes, can be considered as a sort of visual memory of the history of Alviano.&#13;
In the Chapel there is also depicted The Miracle of St Francis and the Swallows, which is reported in the “Fioretti” of St Francis “… began to preach, first ordering the swallows, who were calling, to keep silence until he had finished; and the swallows obeyed his voice.""1 to have happened in Alviano, in 1212. In the fresco the face of the client, Donna Olimpia, is also portrayed.&#13;
Wisely restored, Castello d’Alviano is still the fulcrum of the life of the townspeople today: the Main Floor hosts the Town Hall; the Ground Floor hosts the Documentation Center with its audiovisual equipment on the Fauna of Alviano Oasis and a well equipped and modern convention center; the Basement hosts the Permanent Exhibition of Modern Art and the Rural Culture Museum, which displays more than one thousand items. &#13;
Recently, in honor of its ancient owner, the castle has become the seat of the Documentation Center and Study of the figures of the Captains of Fortune. &#13;

7014,108129,traduzioni_descrizione,en,"“Sociale” Theater&#13;
The Teatro Sociale was instituted with the initiative of a group of nobles and bourgeois people from Amelia in 1780. The theater is extraordinarily similar—in architectural style, structuring and design—to the Teatro La Fenice of Venice, which was designed by the Perugian academic Gian Antonio Selva, who was a colleague at the Academy of Design of the Count Stefano Cansacchi, the architect who designed the Teatro Sociale. &#13;
In 1783, the essential structure was raised, as is indicated in the entablature above the main entrance of the theater, where the motto “HONESTO CIVIUM OBLECTAMENTO”—for the pleasure of the townspeople—admonishes. The orchestra pit dates from 1823 and was opened to respond to the new needs of Lyric Opera. In 1866, the boxes of the proscenium—the theater, apart from the loggia, has 50 boxes available distributed in three orders—were realized. Between 1880 and 1886, the decorations and the frescoes of Domenico Bruschi—active in theatrical decorations, as in the Caio Melisso of Spoleto—were executed. Of the same artist are the decorations of the stage curtain with the splendid Siege of Amelia by Frederick I, Barbarossa, and the vault ceiling of the hall called Salone del Ridotto, famous for its malicious perspective trompe-l’œil. &#13;
It was restructured between 1982 and 1985 with a huge financial contribution of the Società Teatrale. In December 1995 it was reopened to the public. Amelia’s Theater is one of the rarest examples of what remains of 18th century theaters, all made in wood, from the structures to the scenic machines and mechanisms, which have all worked perfectly during the course of its history. The Teatro Sociale is still today property of the Società Teatrale, which was founded for the purpose of its construction. It has hosted almost all the major lyrics of the 18th and 19th century Italian repertoire with the participation of the most important Italian and foreign artists, not counting the symphonic orchestra and chamber music performances. It is also worth mentioning its wide stage, of notable height that has been used as a scene for 42 movies, and some of them are very popular like the “Marchese del Grillo” with Alberto Sordi as the main actor, or the “Pinocchio” of Comencini with Nino Manfredi."

&#13;
The Teatro dei Rustici is located in Monteleone d’Orvieto, a small historical burgh in the extreme north of Terni province.&#13;
The original destination of Monteleone d’Orvieto Theater premises was that of a barn annexed to the old civic palace of the village. This is easily proved by reading the Tempera inscription, painted at the entrance of the audience hall, that says:&#13;
“The Community of Monteleone, which transformed this barn, in the year 1732, into a theater testifies the commoners’ love for civic education and serene training in arts”. &#13;
The small Theater of Monteleone d’Orvieto deserves a visit both for the beauty of its interior, structured in two orders of boxes, and for its theatric program held during the year.&#13;
The Theater of Monteleone d’Orvieto was built in 1732, inside an edifice originally destined to be a granary of the old civic palace of the village, on the initiative of some young people, who requested and obtained from the Municipality the authorization to hold the representation of some comedies during Carnival recurrences.&#13;
Notwithstanding the contrasts inside the public administration, particularly inside the Papal government fearing the representation would be inspired by Risorgimento revolutionary ideas, the theatric activities continued, even in the next centuries.&#13;
With the passing of time, the building was modified—widened and restored—several times, in particular in 1894 and between 1984-1986. Today the Theater has a horseshoe-shape with two orders of boxes that can accommodate up to 99 people."

&#13;
In 1845 the construction of the Teatro Comunale of Narni was decided. It was for this purpose that the Società Teatrale, with the involvement of the Municipality, was founded.&#13;
The architect author of the design was Professor Santini from Perugia, the engineer and director of the construction site was the architect Fedeli, the painter of the vault was Giovanni Traversari, the painters of the sceneries were Nicola Benvenuti of Perugia and Biseo of Rome, who also painted the service curtain called “comodino”. Gioacchino Altobelli of Terni painted the stage curtain depicting an episode from Gattamelata Fortunes.&#13;
The Theater was inaugurated with the representation of the Traviata—whose name was changed by the censorship to the more neutral Violetta—on 3 May 1856, date that coincides with the Patron Saint festivity of Narni. On this occasion, the soprano Carlotta Carozzi Zucchi, prima donna of that evening, was paid tribute with an incision with her portrait and the written dedication: “To Carlotta Carozzi Zucchi, first and absolute prima donna of the Civic Theater of Narni Opening”.&#13;
A long period of activity for the Teatro Comunale started, rich with representations performed by famous companies of prose, opera and lyric, including the famous tenor Begnamino Gigli. After the work of restoration, its audience capacity has changed from the original 6-700 seats to the current 350 and consists of 3 orders of boxes—17 each—and a loggia."

&#13;
The Teatro Mancinelli di Orvieto, important both from a historical and an artistic point of view, is located in the historical center of the town, at a short walking distance from the Duomo, not far from the main square. The visit is recommended for the beauty of the Theater and for its theatrical season and musical events.&#13;
A certain theatrical activity in Orvieto has been registered since the 16th century, with the Accademia dei Giovani—Academy of the Youth—also nicknamed “The Confused”, who convened in the upper room of Palazzo del Popolo. But, in reality, dissatisfaction for a not-very-functional theater and ambition, forced some people to find alternative solutions to the Academy experience. In the 18th century, the family of the Gualtiero created a private theater in Villa del Corniolo, in Porano, today called Villa Paolina. But, to have a real Theater it would be necessary to wait until 1863, year of its inauguration. Designed by Giuseppe Santini, the Theater Mancinelli was inaugurated in 1863. In the same year the interior decoration of the Theater, made with the fanciful mural “grottesche” ornamentation, putti and festoons, was commissioned to Annibale Angelini, who took inspiration from the classical tradition. The artist Giuliano Corsini was engaged to execute the stuccowork, while the figurative painting was commissioned to the Roman Cesare Fracassini, who also painted the stage curtain, concluding the work in 1886. For the evening of the opening the work “Favorita e Marte”, along with the ballets “I Bianchi e I Neri” and “Pedrilla”, were staged. The audience hall floor plan—with its stalls area, four orders of boxes and an upper loggia—has the classical Italian horseshoe-shape. In 1921, the Theater was named after Luigi Mancinelli (1848-1921), famous musician from Orvieto. Today the theater features the original look and has a capacity of five hundred and sixty seats. In the cultural and civic life the theater has always played a central role, today this is reconfirmed by the versatility of its venues, where the variety of activities performed are an evidence: exhibitions, congresses, conferences and meetings with the artists, but also seminars for the study and popularization of cinematographic art."

Villa Paolina, also called “del Corniolo” after the Cornel, for the abundance with which this plant grows in the scrubs of the area, presents itself as a vast complex built on an undulated flat tightly fit between steep tuff cliffs, along the road that from Porano leads to Bagnoregio, in the area of Orvieto. &#13;
If the abundance of trees covers the Villa from indiscrete eyes, it is also true that it is one of the major Parks of Umbria.&#13;
The Villa, at the bottom of a long tree lined street, stands right in the heart of this historical Park, which is one of the most striking of Italy, extending for 9 hectares. The scenographic complex includes various green areas, trees and garden designs of great value, harmoniously inserted into a more rustic environment. All the Estate fits nicely together, on a compositive design that has an orthogonal axis relationship regulating the disposition of both the buildings and the green areas.&#13;
It was built by the Marquis Giovan Battista Gualtiero in 1706, over a pre-existing monastic structure, as a Summer Residence for prelates. &#13;
In 1874, the complex underwent a process of transformation as desired by the Viti Mariani family, before it was handed over to the Casini family. The Villa has been the property of the Province of Terni since the 1980s. It is the seat of the Istituto per l’Agroselvicultura, part of the CNR—the Italian National Research Council—and currently hosts various cultural and sporting events.&#13;
Its structure consists of a central edifice and two lateral wings. The access to the Villa is provided by two lateral curved staircases, which lead into the garden from the terrace below. All the windows of the façade are arched and framed as aedicule. Inside, the Rooms are decorated with a 19th century taste and a Gallery is decorated with grottesche, a decorative style of painting interweaving human and animal forms with foliage and flowers. The main building is completed by minor edifices, such as the Lemon-house, the Farmhouse and the semicircular Exedra.&#13;
Some Etruscan tombs from the 4th century B.C. have been found in the Park."

Standing in a high position, Villa Faina is inside a vast Public Park in the historical center of San Venanzo. The original nucleus of the Villa is a medieval palace, which was an integral part of the fortified burgh of San Venanzo and already belonged to the Count Faina family in 1830, whose offspring started to buy land and edifices with the aim of realizing a large farm in that period. The last transformation, which dates back to the end of the 19th century, gave the complex its current aspect.&#13;
The palace, after the construction of the latest wing, the greenhouse, which protrudes towards the surrounding urban constructions, acquires an L shape. The main body of the building rises for three floors and is characterized both by its rusticated-earthenware framed portal and its high porthole-like circular windows with a squared earthenware frame. The Main Floor is recognizable by the high windows with a pig-iron rail that in the back are larger and intercalated by solid pilasters. The trait d’union for the style of the facades is the presence of the rich earthenware frames, friezes and moldings decorating them, which could be attributed to the Perugian sculptors Raffaele Angeletti and Francesco Biscarini.&#13;
Inside, the Villa is magnificently decorated, as the Hall of Honor, the Dining Room, the Gallery and the “Salotto Celeste”, the Blue Room, show.&#13;
The Park is affected by the fact that the house is built over the remnants of a medieval castle, of which only tracts of the walls remain.&#13;
The edifice has been the property of the Municipality since 1962, and is the seat of the Municipal Council and also a Center for Meetings and Congresses. The Park is the referral point for popular festivals and public events, such as wine and food festivals and cultural activities."
7025,108105,traduzioni_descrizione,en,"Villa Franchetti “Villalago”&#13;
Standing on a hill overlooking a panoramic view of Piediluco Lake, in the Territory of Terni, Villa Franchetti, also called Villalago, is immersed in a Park. The Villa was built by the Baron Eugenio Franchetti between 1888 and 1893, as a vacation house of the family, at the time living in Florence. The edifice, designed by the architect G. Boccini, is clearly a revival of the Renaissance style of typical Tuscan taste.&#13;
The Villa rises for three floors. Welcoming the visitor is the main façade with its entrance portal framed by a Serlian1 loggia closed in brickwork. The façade on the backside, with a central Serlian loggia surmounted by the terrace of the First Floor, is eye capturing. Inside, the Villa contains an important central staircase with beautiful floors of the time and Halls on the Ground Floor with vaulted ceilings, decorated with stucco, gypsum casts or wood. One of the Halls was frescoed by Giulio Mirimao, a painter from Terni. The Warden House and the ex Stables complete the complex.&#13;
The area pertinent to the Villa is a vast Park that has a naturalistic and English-like landscape, realized by exploiting the pre-existent woods that is mainly Pubescent Oaks, integrated with new plantings. Along the western side of the Villa, a small garden with a grassy parterre and a central fountain opens in front of the visitor. It is from here that the green spaces descend down the slope, towards the valley below, with a series of panoramic terracings until arriving at the open theater, which was the seat of cultural and recreational events in the open air until a few years ago. However, the characteristic that makes Villalago Park unique is the presence of the spontaneous Orchids, which in this place have found the ideal conditions to grow. Up until now about 30 species of them have been identified, not including the hybridizing forms.&#13;
The Villa is now property of the Provincial Administration of the Town of Terni.&#13;
